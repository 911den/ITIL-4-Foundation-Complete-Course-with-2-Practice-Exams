1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,200
- Value streams.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,650
We've talked a lot about
the different activities

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,920
inside the service value chain

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,960
and you saw where there
was a lot of overlap

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,280
and coordination where one
activity fed into another

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,000
and then it took that input and created

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,040
another output that went to

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,840
a different value chain activity.

9
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,130
So there's a lot of interconnections here.

10
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,300
Whenever we're trying to
carry out a certain task

11
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,460
or respond to a particular situation,

12
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,750
we create what's known as
a service value stream.

13
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,430
This service value stream
is a specific combination

14
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,840
of activities and practices and each one

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,350
is designed for a particular scenario.

16
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,020
So I might have something that
takes five steps to complete.

17
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,820
It might start in the engage activity

18
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,770
and do three steps there, and then move on

19
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,440
to the deliver and support activity,

20
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,460
where two more steps are conducted.

21
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,210
Now, there may be a different scenario

22
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,820
and a different activity when
we get it from the engage

23
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,120
and there's only two steps
in the engage activity.

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,340
And then it passes it over
to deliver and support,

25
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,950
where there's two other steps.

26
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,840
As you can see, we can
break these things up

27
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,109
in any way we want, and
we can pass information

28
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:02,910
from one to the other.

29
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,110
As each value stream is made
up of different combinations

30
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,730
of value chain activities and practices,

31
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,260
we're going to make sure
that we understand what

32
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,400
the input and the output is,

33
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,760
because understanding what
the input and output is,

34
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,670
is specific to each
particular value stream.

35
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,420
For the two streams I show here,

36
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,460
where you have stream A and stream B,

37
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,190
they're going to go through
a different set of processes

38
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,280
and steps internal to
each of those activities.

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,000
And, that's going to create
a different output based on

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,540
the input it gets.

41
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,409
This is the idea of how we put
all of these things together

42
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:37,470
and create all of these
different value streams,

43
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,540
which are basically going
to be different procedures

44
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,530
or processes as they take
whatever the input is,

45
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,540
do a bunch of things to add value,

46
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,080
and output value on the other side.

47
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,690
That's the whole idea here.

48
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:52,030
And that's why the service
value chain is so important.

49
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,010
It's because of all of these
interrelations that occur

50
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,703
as we move through the
process and add more value.
