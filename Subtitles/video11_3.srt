1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,980
- Now that you've finished
the ITIL 4 Foundation,

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,500
you may be wondering what comes next.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,690
Well, the ITIL path has
several different exams

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,320
that link you up to what we call

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,600
the ITIL Master Certification.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,750
And you'll see here on the screen,

7
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,640
there's actually two distinct paths.

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,980
There's a left path and a right path.

9
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,350
Let's go ahead and start
with the left path.

10
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,390
Now on the left side,

11
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,240
you're working up from ITIL
foundation up to what's learned

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,560
as the MP or ITIL managing professional.

13
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,370
The ITIL managing professional,
to earn that certification,

14
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,630
you have to earn four ITIL
specialist certifications.

15
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,490
Each one of these has
their own exam for them.

16
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,440
Now the ITIL specialist for
create, deliver and support,

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,200
ITIL specialist for
drive stakeholder value,

18
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,690
ITIL specialist for high velocity IT

19
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,860
and ITIL specialist for
direct, plan and improve.

20
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,960
As you take all four of these
exams and you pass them,

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,060
once you get all four,

22
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,130
you are now known as an
ITIL managing professional.

23
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,880
Now if we look on the right side,

24
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,780
you can also become an
ITIL strategic leader.

25
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,880
An ITIL strategic leader is
mostly focused on management

26
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,690
and leadership and has only
two requirements for that.

27
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,060
You'll have to get the ITIL
specialist for direct, plan

28
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,540
and improve and the ITIL
leader certification

29
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,660
for digital and IT strategy.

30
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,070
Now you may have noticed
that one of those exams

31
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,130
is shared on both sides of the chart.

32
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,980
We have the ITIL specialist
for direct, plan and improve

33
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,530
which is found on both the
managing professional path

34
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,550
and the strategic leader path.

35
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,920
So when it comes down to it,

36
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,160
if you've already gotten
the managing professional,

37
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,800
it's only one more exam, the ITIL leader

38
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,910
that will then get you to
being a strategic leader

39
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,090
and when you put both of those together

40
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,090
that then brings you up
to being an ITIL master.

41
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,440
So the entire pathway
is laid out before you.

42
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,070
Which should you go for next?

43
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,380
Well, that's really up to you

44
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,650
and what you do in your organization.

45
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,220
Based on the job that you're doing,

46
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,053
you're going to want to pick

47
00:01:50,053 --> 00:01:52,610
the ITIL specialist or
ITIL leader certification

48
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,880
that most aligns to the role you're doing

49
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,010
and then you'll learn the other roles,

50
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,710
be able to get their
certifications as well

51
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,083
and work your way up to
being an ITIL master.
