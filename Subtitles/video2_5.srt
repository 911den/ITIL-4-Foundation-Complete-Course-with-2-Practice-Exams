1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,110
- So at this point, we've
discussed service management,

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:07,090
value, organizations and people,
and services and products.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,040
In this lesson, I want to briefly consider

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,350
the concept of a service offering.

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,950
The reason I'm spending this
lesson on service offerings

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,690
is because it's a concept
that you need to be able

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,490
to describe and discuss on the exam.

8
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,230
This concept falls under the
understand level of knowledge

9
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,250
for the certification exam.

10
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,970
Now, first, what is a service offering?

11
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,960
Well, a service offering is a description

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,000
of one or more services designed

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,690
to address the needs of
a target consumer group.

14
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,490
In essence, a service provider

15
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,242
is going to present their
services to customers

16
00:00:36,242 --> 00:00:39,660
or consumers in the form
of service offerings.

17
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,860
Which describes one or
more of their services

18
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,310
that are based on one or
more of their products.

19
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,670
Now, service offerings can include goods,

20
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,980
access to resources, and service actions

21
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,250
as part of that service offering.

22
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,380
Let's take my own company

23
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,230
as an example of a service provider.

24
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,200
We have many different
products that can help you

25
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,620
when you're studying for
your certification exams.

26
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,620
We have courses on ITIL, PRINCE2,

27
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,090
and numerous CompTIA certifications.

28
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,918
Each course contains a set of
videos, that's one product,

29
00:01:05,918 --> 00:01:08,960
a practice exam or two,
that's another product,

30
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,870
and some amount of
access to the instructor

31
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,520
to ask questions, that would be a service.

32
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,890
Now, for example, when
you look at all of this,

33
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,290
you may be watching this video

34
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,590
as part of a single service
offering that you've paid for.

35
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,910
Maybe you're watching it as a
part of a subscription service

36
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,309
where you pay every month for
access to videos like ours

37
00:01:25,309 --> 00:01:28,480
and maybe you've paid for
this as a single course.

38
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,910
It really depends on where
you're accessing it from.

39
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,750
You likely got a
different service offering

40
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,620
depending on where you end
up getting our course from.

41
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,740
For example, on our own website,

42
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,580
we don't offer one time purchases

43
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,830
that give you unlimited access for life,

44
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,400
instead, we run a
subscription based service,

45
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,410
where members get access

46
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,139
to every single
certification course we offer

47
00:01:47,139 --> 00:01:49,570
for a low monthly fee.

48
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,290
Because of this, we have our video courses

49
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,110
and our practice exam courses

50
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,680
and students get access to hundreds

51
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,000
of practice exam questions

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,330
as part of that particular
service offering.

53
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,820
Now, other places where we
distribute this course though,

54
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,980
they may not offer a
monthly fee based service

55
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,298
where you can have as much as you want

56
00:02:05,298 --> 00:02:06,131
for as long as you want.

57
00:02:06,131 --> 00:02:07,440
Instead, they may treat the course

58
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,470
as a single product to be sold.

59
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,300
For a one time payment, you're
going to get all of the videos,

60
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,200
the study guide, and maybe
one or two practice exams.

61
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,730
And if you want more practice exams,

62
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,210
well, they're going to treat
that as a separate course

63
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,710
and you're going to have to
pay an additional payment

64
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,950
to get those.

65
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,190
I think you're getting the idea here

66
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,960
as I'm talking about this of
what a service offering is.

67
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,180
It shows you how we can group

68
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,280
and sell those different
products and services

69
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,500
multiple times in multiple different ways,

70
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,870
depending on the consumer
we're trying to reach.

71
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,280
You may have seen this with companies

72
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,920
that offer things as a monthly service

73
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,700
where different service offerings happen

74
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,130
based on the different functionalities

75
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,720
at the different price points.

76
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,710
For example, I use Hulu at my home,

77
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,670
which is a video on demand service.

78
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,830
Hulu has a few different pricing tiers.

79
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,250
The cheapest option is about $8 per month

80
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,320
and it gives you all of
the TV shows you want

81
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,009
but you have to watch commercials.

82
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:56,970
Instead, we decided to opt
for the next higher price

83
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,860
which is going to allow
us to pay $12 per month

84
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,230
but it eliminates all
of those commercials.

85
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,040
Now Hulu has even added a third tier.

86
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,735
They have a $40 per month
offering and this gives you access

87
00:03:05,735 --> 00:03:08,040
to all of the TV without commercials,

88
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,480
but it also gives you
access to live news, sports,

89
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,540
and other things in a
cloud-based DVR service.

90
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,430
So as you moved up the pricing tier,

91
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,870
you got additional services

92
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,260
as part of that service offering.

93
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,730
Now, let's go back one more time

94
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,040
to the definition of a service offering.

95
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,700
If you remember, a service offering

96
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,810
is a description of one or more services

97
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,920
designed to address the needs
of a target consumer group.

98
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,359
Now remember, service
offerings can include goods,

99
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:34,827
access to resources and service actions

100
00:03:34,827 --> 00:03:37,450
as part of that service offering too.

101
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,747
So before we close out this lesson,

102
00:03:38,747 --> 00:03:41,480
we're going to quickly
define these three items.

103
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,980
First, we have goods.

104
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,410
Goods are things that are
supplied to the consumer.

105
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,700
These are things that are transferred

106
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,479
from the service provider to the consumer

107
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,950
and once that occurs,

108
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,880
the consumer is now responsible
for that future use.

109
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,210
For example, if you went

110
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,830
and signed up for a new service offering

111
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,560
from your local cellphone provider,

112
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,580
they're going to give you
a phone that you can use,

113
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,574
but you're now responsible for that phone.

114
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,680
If you break it, you're going
to have to pay to get a new one.

115
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,730
If you lose it, and somebody
makes a thousand dollars

116
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,980
in long distance calls,

117
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,290
well, you're going to be
the one getting the bill.

118
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,260
The goods, meaning the cellphone here,

119
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,456
were transferred from the
service provider to you,

120
00:04:14,456 --> 00:04:16,687
and now, you as consumer
are responsible for it.

121
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:19,880
The second thing the service might offer

122
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,360
is to provide access to resources.

123
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,120
This means, that access to resources

124
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,013
is granted or a license
is given to a consumer

125
00:04:26,013 --> 00:04:29,210
under some agreed terms and conditions.

126
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,710
My website is a great example of this.

127
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,840
When you purchase a
membership at my website,

128
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,500
you're given access to the videos,

129
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,720
the practice exams, hands-on labs,

130
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,670
and all of the other
stuff that we have there.

131
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,170
You're given a license to use them

132
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,410
under the terms and conditions

133
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,470
that you agreed to when you signed up.

134
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,850
These resources all remain

135
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,510
under the service providers control

136
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,570
and the service provider
is responsible for ensuring

137
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,030
that you can use them in
the way it was promised.

138
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,020
Now, here is where
things get a little messy

139
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,770
for consumers sometimes though.

140
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,390
Sometimes you may not like
the way the service provider

141
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,480
is willing to let you use their service.

142
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,736
For example, our website
doesn't allow videos

143
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:05,874
to be downloaded because we're
a subscription based service.

144
00:05:05,874 --> 00:05:08,990
So if you stop paying your
monthly subscription fee,

145
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,500
you stop having access to those videos.

146
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,280
Therefore, we don't want you
to have them all downloaded

147
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,800
on your hard drive where you could sign up

148
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,810
for our service one day,

149
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,300
download all 20 of our courses

150
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,330
and cancel service the next day.

151
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,460
This is because we didn't
transfer the ownership

152
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,550
of that video to you,

153
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,850
instead we're just giving you
the access or a license to it

154
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,140
to use it and watch it as much as you want

155
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,560
as long as your
subscription remains active.

156
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,224
Now, if you don't like
those terms and conditions,

157
00:05:32,224 --> 00:05:34,160
you're going to have to
find a different course

158
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,970
or a different way to purchase that course

159
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,350
that does allow you to
have that one time payment

160
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,980
where you can download it and
use it as much as you want.

161
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,750
But again, that's up to the relationship

162
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,870
between you and your service provider.

163
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,810
As a service provider,

164
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,393
we control the resource and
we're giving you access to it

165
00:05:48,393 --> 00:05:51,110
under this service offering.

166
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,530
Now, the third thing that might be a part

167
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,720
of a service offering is a service action.

168
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,553
This is an action

169
00:05:56,553 --> 00:05:59,100
that's performed to
address a consumer's need.

170
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,530
Let's use the example of a
piece of software you might have

171
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,940
a license for when you're
building a website.

172
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,660
For example, our website
uses a piece of software

173
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,170
as the basis of our
learning management system.

174
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,193
We paid for the software
with a one-time fee,

175
00:06:11,193 --> 00:06:13,760
and we were given rights
to use it indefinitely,

176
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,150
as much as we want without
having to pay any recurring fees.

177
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,459
Now, this falls under that
goods category, right?

178
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:22,709
Well that part of it does
but for that one time fee,

179
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:24,830
we're not going to get any support

180
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,910
and we're not going to get
any updates or patches.

181
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,460
And if we want that technical support

182
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,890
for the software including the patches

183
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,120
and the security updates,

184
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,953
then we're going to have to pay

185
00:06:31,953 --> 00:06:33,800
for that part of the service offering

186
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,340
which is considered a service action.

187
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,470
Because of this, we have
opted to pay an annual fee

188
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,410
to the company and in return for that,

189
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,270
we have 24 hour a day, seven
day a week technical support,

190
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,350
access to their staff, and we
can ask any questions we want,

191
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,320
and we also get access to
all the security updates

192
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,720
and patches as they're
going to be released.

193
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,553
So that's the difference

194
00:06:51,553 --> 00:06:54,760
between goods, access to
resources, and service actions.

195
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,670
Goods are going to be
transferred over to the consumer.

196
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,046
Access to the resources is going to let

197
00:06:59,046 --> 00:07:02,410
the consumer access them
on the terms and conditions

198
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,640
in the license that's been granted

199
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,940
from the service provider.

200
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:06,659
And service actions are
going to be covering

201
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:09,212
things that are going to be ongoing things

202
00:07:09,212 --> 00:07:10,960
like technical support
and customer service fees.

203
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,560
That's the way you need to
remember it for the exam.
