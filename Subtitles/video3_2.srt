1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,010
- Organizations and People.

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,850
Now this is going to
be the first dimension

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,140
we're going to consider.

4
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,450
Now even though we've listed these

5
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,530
one, two, three, and
four, for ITELS purposes,

6
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,610
there not necessarily in a
given order of consideration.

7
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,020
They are just listed that way so

8
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,120
we can have a way to present
it to you inside this video.

9
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,230
But I really do think that
organizations and people

10
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,810
is the first one we need to talk about

11
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,840
because it is really one
of the most important,

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,730
and one of the hardest to get right.

13
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,600
When we talk about
organizations and people

14
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,430
from the service management perspective,

15
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,760
we're thinking about the way

16
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,370
we're going to form our
organizational structures

17
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,550
to support the services and products

18
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,440
that we want to deliver to our end users,

19
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,870
which is those customers
and those consumers.

20
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,110
Now when we talk about
these formal organizations,

21
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,600
this can be something as large or macro

22
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,650
as the way we set up our business.

23
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,900
Is our business going to
be a sole proprietorship?

24
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,270
Is it going to be a limited
liability corporation?

25
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,460
Is it going to be a
multi-level conglomerate?

26
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,740
Is it going to be based
in the United States

27
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,710
or is it going to be based
outside the United States?

28
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,660
All of those things are formal
organizational structures.

29
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,700
But then as we get a little bit

30
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,210
tighter into the organization,

31
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,790
we think about the way we set up

32
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,120
the organizational hierarchy
inside the organization.

33
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,420
Are we going to have a
very vertical organization,

34
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,650
or a very horizontal organization?

35
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,600
Let me give you a couple examples of this.

36
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,780
My company, we happen to be
a fairly flat organization,

37
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,610
we're fairly horizontal.

38
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,400
And that means, because we're small,

39
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,090
we only have five to ten people

40
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,780
who work for us at any given time,

41
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,450
we can talk to each other directly.

42
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,080
We don't have to go up
through bureaucratic channels.

43
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,750
But some places I've worked before

44
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,440
have had hundreds of
thousands of employees.

45
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,980
As somebody down in IT, I
can't go and talk to the CEO.

46
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,500
It's just not the way it works.

47
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,930
I would talk to my manager,

48
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,690
and that manager would
talk to his manager,

49
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,300
and eventually that message
might get up to the CEO.

50
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,210
That's a very vertical organization.

51
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,320
And so these are things you
have to think about when you're

52
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,870
deciding how you're going to
structure your organization.

53
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,330
If you're going to be very
flat and very horizontal,

54
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,150
that means you might be
able to do things quicker,

55
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,510
and faster, and be more creative.

56
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,080
But if you're very vertical,

57
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,450
you might be much more process oriented.

58
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,040
And so these are the kind
of things you think about

59
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,380
when you start thinking about

60
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,800
are we going to deliver our services

61
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,520
through a very formal
organizational structure?

62
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,270
Also when you think about organizations,

63
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,280
how are you going to break up the company?

64
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,430
Are you going to have it broken up into

65
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,190
sales and marketing as one department,

66
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,220
and then the IT services in another?

67
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,920
And then the help desk in another?

68
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,770
And the administration in another?

69
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,020
Well that all depends.

70
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,110
And that's all going to come down

71
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,580
to that formal organizational structure.

72
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,480
Now once you figure out
what that structure is,

73
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,080
you have to staff it with people, right?

74
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,710
We have to find all the right
people to do the right jobs.

75
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,350
And that's the required
staffing and competencies.

76
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,350
That's that whole human resources
part of this whole thing.

77
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,560
So once we figure out
that we have this company,

78
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,730
and we have all these different
departments we've created,

79
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,330
now we have to hire the right managers

80
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,920
and leaders for each of those departments.

81
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,400
And, all the right people
for those departments.

82
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,200
And then we have to make sure those people

83
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,950
stay up to date with their skills.

84
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:50,783
I don't know about you,

85
00:02:50,783 --> 00:02:52,620
but I've been working in IT a long time,

86
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,040
it's been about 20 years.

87
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,180
And computers today
and the way we run them

88
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,140
is completely different than
what we did 20 years ago.

89
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,160
All along the way, my
managers and my leadership

90
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,550
had to make sure I was
going back and getting

91
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,180
new training and new skills

92
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,180
to make sure my competencies
stayed with the current

93
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,630
technologies that were
out in the world today.

94
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,610
And then we have to think about the

95
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,750
roles and responsibilities
for each person.

96
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,820
What is each person's
role in this company?

97
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,300
What are they going to do?

98
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,280
If you're going to be
the everything person,

99
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,920
and in small companies you sometimes

100
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,180
have everything people,
where you have somebody

101
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,210
who is going to be the
teacher, and the editor,

102
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,510
and the marketer, and
the sales person, right?

103
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,420
But in most companies
if you're large enough,

104
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,870
you're going to have a single
role or responsibility.

105
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,210
You're going to be an accountant,

106
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,330
and maybe not just an accountant at large,

107
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,990
but you're going to be
a specific accountant

108
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:41,010
for a specific account or
a specific customer, right?

109
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,260
This is the idea of roles
and responsibilities.

110
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,540
I have people that come to me all the time

111
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,100
and say I want to get into the IT world,

112
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,510
I want to be in IT.

113
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,800
I say, great, what do
you want to do in IT?

114
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,790
Because there are hundreds of
different jobs inside of IT.

115
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,140
You need to figure out what that goal is,

116
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,080
what that role is that you want to attain,

117
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,710
so that way we can figure
out what the right path is

118
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,890
to get you there.

119
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,460
And this brings us down to
our fourth consideration

120
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,010
under organizations and people.

121
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,100
And this is what we call culture.

122
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,140
When we talk about culture,

123
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,580
we're talking about the shared values

124
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,040
and attitudes of that organization.

125
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,170
And this is by far the
hardest thing to get right.

126
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,870
So if you look at a company
that's out in Silicon Valley,

127
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,310
a lot of these startup companies,

128
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,340
they have a very friendly
culture, it's very informal.

129
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,600
You might walk up to
the CEO of the company,

130
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,870
and be like, hey Brian, how's it going?

131
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,340
But if you're working for
somebody like IBM that's a big

132
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,980
company that relies on
processes and procedures,

133
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,980
and everything is done in
this big formal method,

134
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,630
well that's a different culture.

135
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,870
If you look at Facebook,
and you look at IBM,

136
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,100
and you look at a hospital,

137
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,060
they're going to have
three different cultures.

138
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,550
Now, is one of those right
and one of those wrong?

139
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,850
Not necessarily.

140
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,580
It all depends on how your
organization wants to set it up

141
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,170
so they can take care of its organization

142
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,780
and the people inside of it.

143
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,050
Now another part of culture
is the communication

144
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,550
and how are we going to communicate
within the organization.

145
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,360
Are we going to be formal or informal?

146
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,700
Are we going to do it
in person or by email?

147
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,280
All of those things are things that

148
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,040
are a cultural thing
inside your organization.

149
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,640
How much trust and transparency
is there in the company?

150
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,390
Do your leaders up top tell you

151
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,040
what the plans are for the organization?

152
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,130
Do they share the vision?

153
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,480
Do they share the goals?

154
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,060
All that stuff starts at the top

155
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,640
and then works its way down.

156
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,060
If you have bad culture at the top,

157
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,070
you're going to have bad
culture at the bottom, right?

158
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,130
And so we need to make sure we're

159
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,910
getting the right culture
out to our people.

160
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,700
And finally when we're
talking about leaders,

161
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,060
we need to have leaders who have

162
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,680
a vision of where they want to be,

163
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,970
and they need to be
advocating for the values

164
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,270
and for that vision.

165
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,330
So if we're going to say that,

166
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,240
you know our most important thing for us

167
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,650
is making sure that our
people are taken care of,

168
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,340
but then every time your
people have a problem,

169
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,330
you kick them to the
curb and you fire them,

170
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,740
that's not really living the
values you've been setting.

171
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,060
And so you want to make sure as you're

172
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,210
thinking about all this stuff,

173
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,440
how that culture is
going to work together.

174
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,140
So when we think about that organization,

175
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,470
that's all of those pieces.

176
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,120
And then we have the other side of it,

177
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,030
which is the individual people.

178
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,590
Individual people have a lot
of things as well, right?

179
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,870
We have each person has their own

180
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,500
management and leadership style.

181
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,260
Your CEO may have one vision,

182
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,670
and your first level manager
has a different vision,

183
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,550
or a different leadership style, right?

184
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,830
And that's going to be an issue.

185
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,683
And so we need to think about that

186
00:06:06,683 --> 00:06:08,807
when we start talking about
organizations and people.

187
00:06:08,807 --> 00:06:10,210
And also have to think about the people

188
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,800
and updating their
skills and competencies,

189
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,050
like I talked about before.

190
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,860
How we're going to
communicate and collaborate

191
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,680
with our people on our team
and outside of our team.

192
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,340
How we're going to share the knowledge

193
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,280
and share all of our specializations.

194
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,540
And then we also want to think about

195
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,100
how we're going to
facilitate value creation.

196
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,590
Because at the end of the day,

197
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,980
the whole thing about culture
and organizations and people,

198
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,010
is to be able to do something, right?

199
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,260
Creating that product,
creating that service,

200
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,380
which gives value to that consumer.

201
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,340
And if we can't create
value for our consumer,

202
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,160
we're not going to be in
business for very long.

203
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,560
So that's why we have to think about this.

204
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,480
When we think about products and services,

205
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,350
the first dimension we
think about it from,

206
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,300
is through the lens of the
organization and the people.

207
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,960
How are we going to set
up the organization?

208
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,300
How is it going to function?

209
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,770
What kind of culture it's going to have?

210
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,320
And how do we take care of the people

211
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,270
so that the people can deliver
those products and services?
