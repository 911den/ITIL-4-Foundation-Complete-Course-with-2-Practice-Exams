1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,260
- Our fourth and final dimension

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,790
is Value Streams and Processes.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:07,080
Value streams and processes
are going to define

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,650
the activities, the
workflows, the controls

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,800
and the procedures that
are needed to achieve

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,690
the agreed-upon objectives.

7
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,190
These are things like the activities

8
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,140
that the organization
is going to undertake,

9
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,950
how those activities are organized

10
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,710
and how value creation is ensured

11
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,520
for all of your stakeholders
efficiently and effectively.

12
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,540
Now when we talk about this,
let's start with Value Stream.

13
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,650
A value stream is a series of steps

14
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,470
that an organization undertakes

15
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,780
to create and deliver
products and services

16
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,590
to its service consumers.

17
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,730
This is going to combine
all of the organization's

18
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,480
value chain activities.

19
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,000
And we're going to spend
a lot of time talking

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,370
about value chain activities.

21
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,320
In fact, we have an entire section on it.

22
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,820
So let me give you an
example of a value stream.

23
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,120
A value stream is going to
have a series of steps, right?

24
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,870
So let me give you three steps.

25
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,270
I want to go and have lunch today.

26
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,870
So I'm going to go drive
to a fast-food restaurant.

27
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,390
I'm going to go walk inside and
I'm going to go up to the front

28
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,520
and I'm going to order
a hamburger and fries.

29
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,110
That's step one, the order process.

30
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,470
Then I get to step two
which is I'm going to wait

31
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:06,730
while they cook my food.

32
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,160
And then step three they're
going to deliver that food to me

33
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,380
and I can eat it.

34
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,890
That is a value where we're
going to have a transformation

35
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,430
from the raw materials,
we're going to get the order,

36
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,660
take the raw materials, make this burger

37
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,290
and then deliver it back to Jason

38
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:20,850
so Jason can have his lunch.

39
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,640
That's a value stream of three steps.

40
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,530
There's activities in
there that are going to add

41
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,150
to the value of this such as
when they cook the hamburger

42
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,050
and they put on the
ketchup and the mustard

43
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,070
and then they deliver
it to me at my table,

44
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,250
that's all value added.

45
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,510
It gives me value and that's
why I'm paying for it.

46
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,700
But there are some things
that are not value added.

47
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,920
For example, when
they're cooking the fries

48
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,720
there is waste oil that happens.

49
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,940
That's actually considered waste,

50
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,080
they have to throw that away
and pay to get rid of that.

51
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,490
That is a non value-adding activity.

52
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,320
There's also things like
when they get the packaging

53
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,240
with all the hamburgers
and they have to throw away

54
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,290
that package, that's waste as well.

55
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,670
When I leave the table and
I leave my burger and fries

56
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,240
and make a mess, that's a
non value-adding activity

57
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,360
for the organization 'cause
they have to spend time

58
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,490
and money to go clean up that mess, right?

59
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,110
In everything we do, there's things

60
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,230
that add value and there's waste.

61
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,950
And in business, we always
try to minimize the waste

62
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,870
and increase the value.

63
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,230
So that's a basic example

64
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,050
of some value stream activity, right.

65
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,030
We have these three steps,
we're going to order it,

66
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,030
we're going to manufacture
it, we're going to deliver it

67
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,930
and those are value-adding activities.

68
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,720
But there's also those waste activities,

69
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,700
those non-value adds as well.

70
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,520
What we want to do is we want
to optimize the value stream

71
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,810
so we can minimize the amount
of non value-adding activities

72
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,870
while increasing the amount
of value-adding activities.

73
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,600
Once we do that and we get it right,

74
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,340
we then want to automate that
process as much as possible.

75
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,400
So I was talking about
ordering hamburgers for lunch.

76
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,220
Well, if you've gone into
a McDonald's recently,

77
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,370
a lot of them are moving to automation.

78
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,750
They're eliminating the
order-taking process

79
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,310
and getting rid of the cashiers.

80
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,560
And instead they have these giant tablets

81
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,680
that look like giant
iPads and you go in there

82
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,890
and you order your food there

83
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,370
and you pay with your credit card.

84
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,700
It completely eliminated
what they consider

85
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,710
to be non value-adding activity,

86
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,590
having a cashier take your order.

87
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,950
Now they're passing that
work on to you as a consumer

88
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,730
and they're focusing on cooking the food

89
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,200
and handing it to you.

90
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,270
That's the idea here with
optimization and automation.

91
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,990
Now we look at these processes,

92
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,630
what exactly is a process?

93
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,700
Well, it's simply a set of interrelated

94
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,260
or interacting activities that transforms

95
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,500
some input into an output.

96
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,070
Processes are designed to
achieve a specific objective.

97
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,190
In my example, we had a value stream

98
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,240
that was made up of one process

99
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,010
with three different activities;

100
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,950
the ordering, the
manufacturer and the delivery.

101
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,120
And they achieved a specific objective.

102
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,030
That objective, getting
Jason his lunch, right?

103
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,750
And that's the idea of the process,

104
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,900
input some amount of
activities and then an output.

105
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,940
And by well defining your processes,

106
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,640
you can improve your productivity

107
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,520
and then you can also get it optimized

108
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,990
so you can automate it
as much as possible.

109
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,930
And this is why we have our value streams

110
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,340
and processes together in this dimension

111
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,550
because as we're looking at
our products and services,

112
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,370
we're going to ask
ourselves some questions.

113
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,540
we're going to say, what is
the generic delivery model

114
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,500
for the service?

115
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,070
What are the steps that we need to do

116
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,810
to make this service work?

117
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:08,300
Basically, what's the processes
and which set of processes,

118
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,040
when we put them together gives
us the right value stream?

119
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,930
What are the value streams
that are going to be involved

120
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,580
in delivering the agreed-upon
outputs of the service?

121
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,400
So if I think about
giving you video delivery

122
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,390
of this course, there's
a lot of different things

123
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,330
that have to occur.

124
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,920
And we break those down into
what the value stream is

125
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,240
and then each of those pieces,

126
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,920
those steps are the
processes inside of it.

127
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,620
We have to think about who
and what is going to perform

128
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,620
each of those required service actions?

129
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,610
Again, breaking it down into
the individual processes

130
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,960
so we can figure that out.

131
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,530
And that's why this is
considered our fourth dimension

132
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,300
as we're looking at this and figuring out

133
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,210
how are we going to give you that product

134
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:45,080
or that service by doing some processes

135
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,723
as part of a value stream.
