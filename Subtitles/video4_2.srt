1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,040
- Opportunities, demand, and value.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,301
When we consider the service value system,

3
00:00:05,301 --> 00:00:07,500
it's going to take some inputs,

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,650
which come from opportunities and demands,

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,930
do a bunch of processes, activities,

6
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,930
using the guiding
principles, the governance,

7
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,970
and continual improvement to
eventually give us an output,

8
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,540
which we hope is value

9
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,460
that we can share with our
consumers and our customers.

10
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,830
Now, when we look at those inputs,

11
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,080
the first one we have is opportunities.

12
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,830
Opportunities represent
options or possibilities

13
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,730
to add value for stakeholders

14
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,590
or otherwise improve the organization.

15
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,300
Some examples of this, is if
we're going to find new markets,

16
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,820
or find new customers.

17
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,270
We might create a new service,
or create a new product.

18
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,860
There's lots of different ways for us

19
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,320
to figure out what
those opportunities are,

20
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,940
and then bring those to market
so we can help add value.

21
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,750
For example, when I first
started teaching ITIL,

22
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,060
I didn't have the ability, as a partner,

23
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,180
to be able to sell
vouchers to my students.

24
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,320
And so, my students, when they
finished taking my course,

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,770
would go to PeopleCert or
they would to to Pearson View,

26
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,060
and they would order their voucher,

27
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,870
and pay for their exam directly there,

28
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,410
and then take the exam.

29
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:04,540
The problem with that

30
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,650
is that made them have
to pay full retail price.

31
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,910
Now, one of the things we've done,

32
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,310
is we've been able to
partner with PeopleCert

33
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,960
and partner with Axelos so
we can get those vouchers

34
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,690
and buy them in bulk, so
we can buy a lot of them,

35
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,140
and pay a much lower price,

36
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,200
and pass the savings on to our students.

37
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,360
So now our students can
come to our website,

38
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,070
buy those vouchers, and save
about $50 off the retail price,

39
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,630
because they're buying it through us.

40
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,780
It was a way that we were able

41
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,840
to give our customers more
value by offering a product.

42
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,700
It wasn't necessarily a service,

43
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,160
because it's not something
that we were doing,

44
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,790
we're just buying them in bulk,

45
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,210
and then reselling them to you,

46
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,190
and passing those savings on to you.

47
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,630
But it added value for our students,

48
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,520
because now they can buy

49
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,580
their training and their
certification exams

50
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,720
through us at a much cheaper rate.

51
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,470
That was an opportunity we
saw, and we decided to take it,

52
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,550
and so we built different
processes in place

53
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,600
and practices to make that a reality,

54
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,640
so you can get your vouchers that way.

55
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,360
Now, the other input we have is demand,

56
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,090
and demand is when there is need or desire

57
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,510
for products and services

58
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,000
among your internal or external consumers.

59
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,840
What does this look like?

60
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,540
Well, I get this on a
daily basis in our company.

61
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,300
I have students who finish an exam

62
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,380
and they send me an email and
say hey I passed this exam,

63
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,870
do you offer this new other certification?

64
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,690
Or I would love it if you
offered this certification.

65
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,370
And so they have a demand,
an external consumer,

66
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,320
who wants something from our company,

67
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,750
and they're telling us about it.

68
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,590
Hey, I passed ITIL and
I want to take Prince2,

69
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,780
do you offer that?

70
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,740
Well, because enough students asked us to,

71
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,979
we went and did a Prince2
course, and we offer that now.

72
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:39,060
So, we do take input from our students,

73
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,360
and that helps us shape

74
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,360
what products and services
we're going to do.

75
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,010
One of the things students
have asked a lot for,

76
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,780
is they want more hands on practice

77
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,710
in our IT certification courses,

78
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,500
so we're building labs
where students can login

79
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,200
and do actual actions instead
of just watching it on video.

80
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,950
Those are the kind of
things that demand has fed

81
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:00,030
and now we have put that through
our service value system,

82
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,470
and through our service value chain

83
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,140
to create products and services

84
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,900
that can come out the other side

85
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,800
and give value to our students.

86
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,450
Which brings us to the outcome
of the service value system,

87
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,880
which is the value,
that's the output, right?

88
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,470
The output or the outcome.

89
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,410
And when we look at that,

90
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,160
the service value system is
going to enable the creation

91
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,070
of many different types of value

92
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,180
for a wide group of stakeholders.

93
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,970
So, when I think about value,

94
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,223
and I look at it from
a service perspective,

95
00:03:25,223 --> 00:03:28,692
there is a value that we,
as an organization, get.

96
00:03:28,692 --> 00:03:31,400
For example, when we talk
about the exam vouchers,

97
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,610
well, there's a value that
we get from doing that.

98
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,100
By buying those all and
doing all the processing,

99
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,480
we do keep a little bit of money,

100
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,320
and we make a little bit
of profit off of that.

101
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,430
So there's value for my
company in doing that.

102
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,780
Because again, we have
to pay our employees

103
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,760
and we have to make some
overhead to do that.

104
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,770
There's also value

105
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,790
for our other stakeholders, our students.

106
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,800
Instead of paying full retail
price, you get $50 off,

107
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,400
and so that saves you money

108
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,310
and it gives you the
thing you need, right?

109
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,900
We're giving you value there.

110
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,260
We might have value from
other organizations.

111
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,050
I actually have some
deals with some colleges,

112
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,150
and when they go through and
they teach their students IDIL4

113
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,450
they want to be able to
buy those vouchers as well.

114
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,710
But they don't buy it
in the same bulk we do,

115
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,350
because we buy thousands
and tens of thousands

116
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,590
of these vouchers a year,

117
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,370
and so we get a much lower price.

118
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,880
So we actually sell those
vouchers, some of those,

119
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,640
to these colleges for their students

120
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,380
in groups of 20 or 50,

121
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,970
and they get a little bit of a lower price

122
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,750
than you as an individual student do,

123
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,150
because they are buying
so many of them, right?

124
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:25,983
And so, again,

125
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,170
we have value for a bunch of
different stakeholders here,

126
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,750
with the same exact product or service.

127
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,930
Because of the way that
service value system works,

128
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,640
that can happen, right?

129
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,310
Amazon built an entire server
farm to house their website,

130
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,790
and then they go, hmm,
I bet we can sell this

131
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,640
to other companies too, and they do.

132
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,670
It's called amazon web services,

133
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,070
and that means they can take that,

134
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,830
and give different value
to different stakeholders,

135
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,900
that's the idea.

136
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,950
So, we look at this service
value system from left to right.

137
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,330
We're looking at inputs of opportunities,

138
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,970
what new markets, new
customers, new services,

139
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,320
and new products can you have?

140
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,540
As well as demand,

141
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,880
what things do these people want to buy,

142
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,530
internally or externally?

143
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,110
And then on the output
side, we have value,

144
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,430
for those internal and
those external consumers,

145
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,030
for the business, for the organization,

146
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,400
for all of your customers
and all of your consumers.

147
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,790
That's the idea of the
service value system.

148
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,253
Take something in, add value,
and put it out the other side.
