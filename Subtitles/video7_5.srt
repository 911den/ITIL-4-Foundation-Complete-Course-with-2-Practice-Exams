1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,620
- Where do we want to be?

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:03,860
Coming out of step two,

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,800
we now know where we are
in terms of our baseline.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,830
This now begs the question,
where do we want to be?

5
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,010
Let's pretend that you're
back in college again.

6
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,160
When you started the school
year, you had a vision.

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,250
This is step one.

8
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,730
And your vision was you're going to own

9
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,230
a 3.5 grade point average.

10
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,000
Now you just finished your first semester

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,480
and you got your grades back.

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,680
Unfortunately, you didn't
do as well as you thought

13
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,180
and you earned some B's and some C's.

14
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,790
Now you're looking at
your grade point average

15
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,990
and you see that you earned a 2.9.

16
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,190
That's the second step.

17
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,270
Where are we now?

18
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,103
We're at a 2.9.

19
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,240
Now you need to decide if this semester

20
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,810
is going to be different and
if you've made that decision,

21
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,180
we're going to go ahead and try to do

22
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,650
some improvement initiatives.

23
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,880
You might study longer
or study differently.

24
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,200
Now you've decided that by
the end of the school year,

25
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,450
you want to have a 3.3 GPA.

26
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,230
And by the end of next school year,

27
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,660
you want to achieve an
initial vision of 3.5.

28
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,880
This is what we're going
to be doing in step three.

29
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,090
We're going to decide where we want to be.

30
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,400
Both in the short term and the long term.

31
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,320
During this step, we're going
to perform a gap analysis.

32
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,240
This is going to look
at our overall vision,

33
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,260
where we currently are
and where we want to be

34
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,050
over some amount of time.

35
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,400
Based on this analysis,

36
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,680
we're going to be able to
determine what that delta is,

37
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,090
what the gap is.

38
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,830
So, for example, if I say
I wanted to have $1,000

39
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,750
in my bank account, but
I only have $100 today,

40
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,123
well, the gap is $900.

41
00:01:23,123 --> 00:01:27,390
1,000, where I want to be versus
the $100 I currently have.

42
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,250
Therefore, we need to figure out a way

43
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,500
of what we're going to
do to get us $900 more.

44
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,350
Now in the case of IT systems,

45
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,530
it's usually not going
to be monetary related.

46
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,640
It will be based on
some key metrics though.

47
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,880
This is going to be based on things

48
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,020
like critical success factors or CSFs

49
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,180
or key performance indicators, KPIs.

50
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,700
Either way, in the business world,

51
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,390
we refer to these generally as metrics.

52
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,220
These metrics are what we're
going to use to measure things

53
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,460
and figure out what the gap is.

54
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,910
Now it's important to note here

55
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,260
that our vision from step one

56
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,810
may be something that
is totally aspirational

57
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,830
and never going to be obtained truly.

58
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,600
The reason for this is
because sometimes our vision

59
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,620
is going to be beyond
what we can ever get to.

60
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,470
Let's use the example of
our college GPA again.

61
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,820
Let's say your vision
was to graduate college

62
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,130
with a perfect score.

63
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,190
A 4.0 GPA.

64
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,090
Well, based on our current
state that we found in step two,

65
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,580
we're never going to be
able to reach that 4.0

66
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,920
because we already earned
some B's and some C's,

67
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,220
which is going to lower
our overall average.

68
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,100
Now that's fine.

69
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,821
We can keep the vision
of graduating with a 4.0,

70
00:02:30,821 --> 00:02:32,830
but we know we're never going to reach it.

71
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,090
Maybe we can get up to a 3.8
but we'll never get to 4.0.

72
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,060
It's just the way math works, right.

73
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,730
So now, here in step three,

74
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,050
we're going to create smaller
goals that we can reach

75
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,230
as we try to get closer and
closer to the actual vision,

76
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,580
whether or not we ever obtain
that actual vision in the end.

77
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,680
So now in step three,
we're going to figure out

78
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,630
where do we want to be and
we're going to set our goals.

79
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,080
We're going to agree to those
key performance indicators,

80
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,410
those metrics, such as the KPIs

81
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,370
and the critical success factors.

82
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,580
But at this point, we still
haven't taken any actions

83
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,220
to actually improve, right.

84
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,690
We've just set out our
goals, but that's okay,

85
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,380
because next in step four,

86
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,100
we're going to begin to formulate our plan

87
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,950
in order to start taking some action.
