1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,510
- It's finally time to take some action.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,830
We have our vision, we have our baseline,

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,110
we have our goals, and we have our plan.

4
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:10,310
Now in step five we're
going to take action

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,480
and put those plans into motion.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,270
When you're taking action you can do this

7
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,190
under a traditional waterfall approach,

8
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,660
where a large improvement initiative

9
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,310
is broken down into phases,

10
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,480
a lot of planning and
preparation is performed

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,910
and then a large sweeping change occurs

12
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,540
over a very short period of time,

13
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,680
and you transition to the new system.

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,880
This may work when you needed

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,080
to take a really old system, for example,

16
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,910
and completely replace it.

17
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,600
But, most of the time, you're
probably going to take action

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,610
in smaller iterations, using
a much more agile methodology.

19
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,610
In this case, you're
going to deliver smaller

20
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,220
product and service improvements,

21
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,370
but you're going to do
them much more frequently

22
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,920
creating incremental but
smaller wins and value.

23
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,800
Either method'll work
and it really depends

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,490
on your situation on which
one you're going to use.

25
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,150
During this effort there needs to be

26
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,420
a continual focus on
measuring your progress

27
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,480
towards the vision, managing
your risk during those changes,

28
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,360
and ensuring visibility and
awareness of the initiative

29
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,230
is spread throughout the organization

30
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,470
so everybody knows what's going on.

31
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,510
Once the improvement
initiative is complete,

32
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,380
we then can move on to step six

33
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,480
and find out if we were successful or not.
