1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460
- In this lesson, we're going
to discuss the PESTLE model.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,930
Now before we do, I want
to point out that this part

3
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:07,511
is not going to be on the exam.

4
00:00:07,511 --> 00:00:09,820
The only reason I'm
bringing it up is because

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,690
you may have been asking
yourself back in the

6
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,270
introduction to this
section why do we have these

7
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,461
external factors around the
outside of our four dimensions.

8
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:20,470
We have a value in the
center and then around that

9
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,130
we had the products and services.

10
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,860
We had our four dimensions
that are the four perspectives

11
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,120
we look at our services,
but there are these

12
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,872
external factors circling
around the outside.

13
00:00:29,872 --> 00:00:31,581
And that's why I wanted to discuss here.

14
00:00:31,581 --> 00:00:33,890
These are known as the PESTEL model,

15
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,579
which is a generic open-source model

16
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,840
that stands for the acronym
of PESTLE P for political,

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,029
E for economic, S for
Social, T for technological

18
00:00:43,029 --> 00:00:45,643
L for legal and E for environmental.

19
00:00:45,643 --> 00:00:48,760
Now, these are six things
that are outside of your

20
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,080
organization that you can't control.

21
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,403
There are going to happen to you.

22
00:00:52,403 --> 00:00:55,030
But they are external factors
that you have to think about

23
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,994
when you are designing
a service or a product.

24
00:00:56,994 --> 00:00:59,150
Now these are the things that are

25
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,520
outside your control, right?

26
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,631
So let's think about
one of a great example.

27
00:01:02,631 --> 00:01:05,120
I've used this example a
lot throughout this course,

28
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,120
but the example of Uber or Lyft,

29
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,683
those ride-sharing services.

30
00:01:08,683 --> 00:01:11,380
When they first came out,
they were a completely

31
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,290
different model and so there
was a social component of it.

32
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,156
Would people be willing
to embrace this idea

33
00:01:17,156 --> 00:01:19,800
that they can get into a stranger's car

34
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,480
by summoning them with their
app, they could come up

35
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,900
and you get in their car
and they drive you to your

36
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,770
destination as opposed to
using a traditional taxi.

37
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,220
That's a different sociodynamic
than we are used to.

38
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,620
And so that was something that
people were worried about.

39
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,570
They couldn't really control that as Uber.

40
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,130
They had to just hopefully
get enough people to change

41
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,570
their minds in society
that it became commonplace

42
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,340
and now most of us don't think twice

43
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,050
about taking an Uber, do we?

44
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,950
Another one might be technological.

45
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,970
Maybe you're facing some
challenges as you are trying

46
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,660
to figure out how to build your service

47
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,530
that you don't have the
right technology to do it

48
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,613
because that technology doesn't exist yet.

49
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:54,480
For example, maybe you want
to make sure you have this

50
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,088
ultra safe encryption and
so you want to design it

51
00:01:57,088 --> 00:02:00,680
with quantum resistant
technology but quantum computers

52
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,060
don't exist yet, so you
can't quite do that.

53
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,326
And when quantum computers do come out,

54
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:07,814
all of the existing technology
and encryption we're using

55
00:02:07,814 --> 00:02:09,950
is going to be consider obsolete.

56
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,754
And so that's a technological impact

57
00:02:11,754 --> 00:02:14,715
external to our environment
that we really can't control.

58
00:02:14,715 --> 00:02:16,705
There's also legal impacts.

59
00:02:16,705 --> 00:02:18,630
I'll go back to the Uber example.

60
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,310
There are cities and there are
countries that have actually

61
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,730
made it illegal for Uber to operate there.

62
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,122
They said that you have
to have a taxi license

63
00:02:26,122 --> 00:02:28,780
to be able to run a taxi type service

64
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,100
and therefore, Uber cannot
be run there and they have

65
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,930
pushed Uber out of those communities.

66
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,240
That's a legal restriction
that they can't get through

67
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,550
until they can get that law changed.

68
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,850
How do you get a law changed?

69
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,520
Well, you try to get some
political pressure, right?

70
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,150
And so maybe you are going
to have to put effort

71
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,650
in lobbying into changing
the minds of the political

72
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,370
culture so they can change
the law and make it so it's

73
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,160
acceptable for you to run
your service into those areas.

74
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,690
All of these things are things
that are going to affect us.

75
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,840
That's the PESTLE, the political,
the economic, the social,

76
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,490
the technological, the
legal and the environmental.

77
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:02,590
Again, for the exam, you don't
have to memorize these six.

78
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,900
It's just something for
you think about as you're

79
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,200
considering your services
and you're building them

80
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,360
because it is something
that may impact you

81
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,060
depending on the choices you make.
