1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,970
- Workforce and talent management.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,220
This is our final practice as
a general management practice,

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,450
and this is going to
finish up this section.

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,850
This practice again is
not covered by the exam,

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,130
but it's one that you probably deal with

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,830
on a daily basis.

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,380
Workforce and talent
management is there to ensure

8
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,850
that an organization has
the right people with the

9
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,460
appropriate skills and
knowledge, in the correct roles

10
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,560
to support its business objectives.

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,968
This practice covers a
wide variety of activities,

12
00:00:25,968 --> 00:00:28,780
focused on successfully
engaging with the organization's

13
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,960
employees and people-based resources,

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,640
including how to plan for them,
recruit them, onboard them,

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,660
help them in their
learning and development,

16
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,170
ensure you're doing proper
performance measurement of them,

17
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,360
and doing succession planning.

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,580
There is a lot to this, in fact the

19
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,820
entire field of human
resources rests inside of

20
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,980
workforce and talent management.

21
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,530
Now, we're not going to go into
all of the details of this,

22
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,090
but think about it this
way, your company is

23
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,110
really nothing without its people.

24
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,020
We want to make sure we
have the best people,

25
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,330
and that means we have to figure out how

26
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,710
we're going to plan to recruit them.

27
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,590
We need to recruit them,
we need to hire them

28
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,650
and bring them onboard, we
want to make sure that they're

29
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,330
being adapted over time,
by learning and developing

30
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,560
their resources, for better abilities,

31
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,900
and, we want to measure
their abilities to make sure

32
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,510
we're getting the resources
out of them that we expect,

33
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,760
and they're performing
to the level they should.

34
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,920
All of this are things
that are important inside

35
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,640
workforce and talent management,

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,640
because people are usually considered the

37
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,800
number one resource of any company.

38
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,840
I know in our company,
if we lost a couple of

39
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,940
our lead people, we would
be in really dire straits.

40
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,590
So we want to make sure we
have the right people and

41
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,170
we're developing new people
to take over those roles

42
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,880
when those people decide to leave us,

43
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,793
and that's called succession planning.
