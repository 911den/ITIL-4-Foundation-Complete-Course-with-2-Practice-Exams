00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:04,030
- Business analysis, this practice is one

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,900
that you don't need to know for the exam,

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,550
but we're covering it for
your general awareness.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,260
Business analysis is the practice

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,270
of analyzing a business or
some element of that business

6
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,770
to define its needs,
and recommend solutions

7
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,960
to address those needs, or
to solve a business problem.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,940
This will help you create
value for your stakeholders.

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,040
So when I think about business analysis,

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,620
you're thinking about this
outside of the IT realm.

11
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,200
Normally you're thinking
about dollars and cents.

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,640
How can I solve some
sort of business problem?

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,820
And that might be with a
technological solution,

14
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,580
but it might be with an
organizational solution,

15
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,610
or it might be with a new marketing plan,

16
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,310
or whatever it happens to be.

17
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,190
The business analysis, the reason it's put

18
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:44,800
under this technical
heading inside this category

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,870
is because it often relies
heavily on lots of facts

20
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,650
and lots of figures, and
they use a lot of technology

21
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,860
to do the analysis, but
the actual analysis itself

22
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,810
is more of a management function
than a technical function.
