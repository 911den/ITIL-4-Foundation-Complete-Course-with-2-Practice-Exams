1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:02,945
- Utility and warranty are two terms that

2
00:00:02,945 --> 00:00:05,910
every ITIL student simply has to know.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,710
They're going to come
up time and time again

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,310
throughout your training
and in the real world.

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,860
Utility refers to the
functionality offered by a

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,150
particular product or service
to meet a particular need.

7
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:19,100
This really is what the
product or service does.

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,580
Utility is what we refer
to as fit for purpose.

9
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,750
Now, let's take a look
at warranty for a moment,

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,960
and then we're going to compare and

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,460
contrast these two terms,

12
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,430
because comparing and
contrasting these terms

13
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,010
is something you're
going to see on the exam.

14
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,600
Warranty is the assurance
that the product or service

15
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,940
will meet the agreed upon requirements.

16
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,160
It is how a service performs.

17
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,240
Warranty is concerned
with the services ability

18
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,520
to accomplish what it needs to do.

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,550
This is often referred to as fit for use.

20
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,582
Now, to compare and
contrast these two terms,

21
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:51,190
let's use the example of a car.

22
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,390
As a consumer,you have
a requirement to drive

23
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,770
a car from Point A to Point B.

24
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:56,680
You want it to get at least

25
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,100
35 miles per gallon of fuel efficiency,

26
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,250
and you live somewhere that
gets really hot in the summer,

27
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,700
and really cold in the winter,

28
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,940
so you want a good cold
air conditioning system,

29
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,890
and a really nice warm heater.

30
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,550
Now, let's consider these requirements,

31
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,130
and determine if it meets
our utility standard.

32
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,820
Remember, utility is about
something being fit for purpose.

33
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,500
And if I have a small family,

34
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,560
I may be able to fit
my wife and my two kids

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,030
in a four door sedan like a Toyota Prius.

36
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,950
So, to carry the family
from Point A to Point B,

37
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,600
the Prius would be fit for purpose,

38
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,890
and it would meet my utility functions.

39
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,470
In addition to this,
if I bought a brand new Prius,

40
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,730
it would certainly have
high enough fuel efficiency

41
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,670
and have a really nice air
conditioner and heating system,

42
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,260
so it's going to meet my
warranty requirements as well.

43
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,130
Remember, warranty is
all about fit for use.

44
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,160
Does it meet the requirements
stated by the consumer?

45
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,980
So, since, I'm the consumer,

46
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,530
I'm going to say it had to have at least

47
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,630
35 miles a gallon of fuel efficiency,

48
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,490
and a working air conditioner and heater.

49
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,090
And this brand new Prius will

50
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,150
certainly meet those requirements.

51
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,890
This means it's deemed fit for use.

52
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,060
Now, let's say that I bought the car,

53
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,640
a few years go by,
and my wife has another child.

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,880
Uh-oh.
We already had two kids,

55
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,960
so this little Prius isn't
going to be very good

56
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,380
for carrying my entire
family around anymore.

57
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,870
It no longer is going
to be fit for purpose.

58
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,120
Because any time I want to go
out for dinner as a family,

59
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,810
we're now going to have to take two cars,

60
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,530
because we all can't fit
into the little Prius.

61
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,100
The warranty might still be there,

62
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,590
because the air conditioner still works,

63
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,820
and the heater still works,

64
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,120
and it still gets over
35 miles per gallon.

65
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,630
But, the intended purpose
of getting us all from

66
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,610
Point A to Point B simply
can't be accomplished.

67
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,130
There is not enough seats,
and not enough seat belts.

68
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,790
And since utility is concerned
with fit for purpose,

69
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,330
this Prius is no longer
meeting my utility needs.

70
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,900
So, hopefully this little
example helps you understand

71
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,400
the difference between
utility and warranty.

72
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,330
Remember for the exam that
what a service does is utility.

73
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,980
That's driving from Point A to Point B.

74
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,700
On the other hand,
how this service does it needs

75
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,610
to be considered as part of warranty.

76
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,450
That's getting 35 miles per gallon,

77
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,010
and keeping the inside of the
car at the right temperature.

78
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,970
Not too hot and not too cold.

79
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,130
Now, one of the important
things to remember

80
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,361
is that you need both
utility and warranty for

81
00:03:06,361 --> 00:03:08,670
a service to operate successfully.

82
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,300
In the IT world,
we often see people focus on

83
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,330
the warranty and they
simply forget about utility.

84
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,930
If I have a service that
runs on a wonderful and

85
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,600
elastic cloud infrastructure,

86
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,140
that can handle millions
of users simultaneously.

87
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,230
That is warranty.
IT people like warranty.

88
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,710
Because it's easy to measure.

89
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,590
If you require that a
service has a defined

90
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,260
and agreed upon condition,
and you meet those conditions,

91
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,554
you have good warranty.

92
00:03:31,554 --> 00:03:34,000
Warranty simply requires
that a service support

93
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,300
the performance of the consumer or removes

94
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,040
the constraints from the consumer.

95
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,420
If the service can be used
effectively by the users

96
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,080
to share their latest social
media posts on the other hand,

97
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,300
that would be considered utility.

98
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,460
If the service is always up,
meaning it has great warranty,

99
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,950
but it doesn't perform the service that

100
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,370
the customer wants it to do,

101
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,650
meaning it hasn't gotten good utility,

102
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,210
then the service is simply
going to end up failing.

103
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,735
You can't run a successful service without

104
00:03:57,735 --> 00:04:00,490
both utility and warranty.

105
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,760
Now, for the exam,

106
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,540
let me give you a couple of tips.

107
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,110
A dead giveaway that they're
talking about warranty

108
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,810
is if they start mentioning
things like availability,

109
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,980
capacity, security levels, and continuity.

110
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,535
These infrastructure measurements
are almost exclusively

111
00:04:14,535 --> 00:04:17,880
in the domain of how a
service does what it does.

112
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,710
And it makes it fit for use.

113
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,780
Therefore, these are
warranty considerations.

114
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,613
On the other hand,

115
00:04:23,613 --> 00:04:26,700
if it starts talking
about the way it performs,

116
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,990
and the fact that it allows somebody

117
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,750
to accomplish some outcome,

118
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,040
then they're usually
talking about utility.

119
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,190
Which is your fit for purpose.

120
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,580
Again, going back to our car,

121
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,840
can it drive from Point A to Point B?

122
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,200
That's utility.

123
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,330
How many miles per gallon
it gets and how long

124
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,710
the engine stays up and how cold it gets.

125
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,283
Those are all warranty.
