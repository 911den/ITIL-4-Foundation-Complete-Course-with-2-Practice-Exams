00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,060
- The Release Management practice.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,100
This is another one that you
have to recall the purpose of.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,550
So, what is that purpose?

4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,890
Well, the purpose of
Release Management practice

5
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,580
is to make new and changed services

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,810
and features available for use.

7
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,740
Basically, it's going to
provide us some set of processes

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,150
that we're going to have to go through

9
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,970
to get the thing from the
design all the way out

10
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,420
until it's finally live
in the environment.

11
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,970
Generally, this will involve
having a release plan,

12
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,890
will have the newer
changed infrastructure,

13
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,230
newer changed software,

14
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,320
and newer changed documentation
and training given to us

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,740
and then we'll be able to put it into

16
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,880
the deployment and release process.

17
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,660
And this is where we're going to review it

18
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,980
and eventually release it
so that it can be deployed

19
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,400
into the environment.

20
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,430
That's the whole purpose
of release management.

21
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,980
We don't want things to just get put out

22
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,820
into the environment
without us knowing about it.

23
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,750
We want to properly transition them

24
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,300
and take them from design,

25
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,130
through testing and transition,

26
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,650
out and then be released

27
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,270
into the operation environment,

28
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,920
and make sure that the service
desk is ready to support it

29
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,673
inside deliver and support.
