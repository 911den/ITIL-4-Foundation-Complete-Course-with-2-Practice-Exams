1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:03,030
- Continual improvement.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,920
Our first general management practice

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,460
is continual improvement.

4
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,950
And for the exam, this is
the one you need to know

5
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,080
in depth from this section.

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,340
For this one, you need to be able

7
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,240
to explain continual improvement,

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,770
what its purpose is, and how it applies

9
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,520
throughout the value chain.

10
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,440
So when we talk about
continual improvement,

11
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,360
what exactly is its purpose?

12
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,180
Well, the purpose of the
continual improvement practice is

13
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,810
to align the organization's
practices and services

14
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,270
with changing business needs

15
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,440
through the ongoing
identification and improvement

16
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,450
of services, service
components, practices,

17
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,050
or any other element involved

18
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,350
in the efficient and effective
management of products

19
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:42,300
and services; basically, how
do we make things work better.

20
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,660
That's what continual
improvement is all about.

21
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,410
Now when we think about
continual improvement,

22
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,160
there's a couple of key
things that it focuses on.

23
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,570
First, we wanta encourage
continual improvement

24
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,320
across the organization.

25
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,260
We always wanta be aiming
for something bigger, better,

26
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,170
faster, cheaper, or more efficient.

27
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,580
The second key function of
continual improvement is

28
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,460
to secure time and budget
for continual improvement.

29
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,080
It's really easy in an
organization to keep working

30
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,000
on the same things day in and day out

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,150
and not think about how to improve.

32
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,350
You wanta make sure you're
securing that time and budget

33
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,390
so we can continue to work
on improving our processes.

34
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,310
Next, we wanta think about identifying

35
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,540
and logging improvement opportunities.

36
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,037
Anytime you're working on
something, you might have an idea

37
00:01:24,037 --> 00:01:26,590
and say, "You know, this would
be better if we did x thing."

38
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:29,470
At that point we wanta log
that down, identify it,

39
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,840
and that way, eventually, we
might be able to get back to it

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,900
and cause that improvement to happen.

41
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,970
Another thing we wanta
think about is how we assess

42
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,270
and prioritize our
improvement opportunities.

43
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,190
You may have a hundred great ideas,

44
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,340
but which one should we work on first?

45
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,370
That's part of continual improvement.

46
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,650
We also wanta think
about how we're going to

47
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,020
make a business case for
those improvement actions.

48
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,550
At some point, you need to get budget

49
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,700
for your improvement, right?

50
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,700
So you're going to haveta think
about how we're going to be able

51
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,560
to do that and make the case for it up

52
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,090
to your senior leadership
or your senior management.

53
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,117
Maybe you're going to say
something like, "Hey, boss,

54
00:01:59,117 --> 00:02:00,987
"I think we should do
this improvement action.

55
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,667
"It's going to take us 20
hours right now to build it,

56
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:05,757
"but it's going to save
us 10 hours a week.

57
00:02:05,757 --> 00:02:08,307
"So in just two weeks, we're
going to make up that time.

58
00:02:08,307 --> 00:02:09,780
"It's a great idea."

59
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,440
That would be an example of
making your business case.

60
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,360
Next, we wanta think about
how we're going to plan

61
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,490
and implement those improvements;
and we wanta figure out

62
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,600
how we're going to measure
and evaluate the improvements

63
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,550
and the results of those improvements.

64
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,490
Again, we've talked a lot
about this when we talked

65
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,240
about the continual improvement model

66
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,010
in the last section of the course.

67
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,740
This is just the formal practice

68
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,540
that is going to work that model.

69
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,280
And we also wanta make
sure we're coordinating

70
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,830
our improvement activities
across the organization.

71
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,810
Remember, we wanta think
holistically and act widely

72
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,420
across the organization
for the best improvements.

73
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,300
Now when we're working
with continual improvement,

74
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,830
there's a lot of different tools

75
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,650
that we can put into our toolbox.

76
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,530
These are things like methods,
and models, and techniques.

77
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,490
This is things like lean
methods where we're trying

78
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,090
to reduce waste, multiphase
projects where we're trying

79
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,630
to organize the way
we're going to do things

80
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,350
and get incremental improvements.

81
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,310
We might do maturity
assessments to figure out

82
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,960
how mature our organization is,

83
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,290
and are we operating at peak efficiency.

84
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,950
We might be using development ops

85
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,160
so that we can develop
things quicker and faster

86
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,670
and get them into market.

87
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,710
We might use something
like a balance score card

88
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,890
where we look at the improvement,

89
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,980
and we look at it through the lens

90
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,810
of those four different
dimensions of service management.

91
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,310
We also might be using agile
improvements and techniques.

92
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,180
We might be trying to get some quick wins.

93
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,300
Or we might even do a SWOT analysis.

94
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,990
And a SWOT analysis is something

95
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,360
that they teach in business school.

96
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,950
It's where you list out the
strengths, the weaknesses,

97
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,470
the opportunities, and the
threats; and then you figure out

98
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,960
how that applies to your given initiative.

99
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,900
Now all of this is great.

100
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,880
And there's one more technique or tool

101
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,000
that you should be using,

102
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,730
and it's called a Continual
Improvement Register.

103
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,330
Now a Continual Improvement
Register or CIR is a database

104
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,180
or a structured document that we use

105
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,620
to track and manage all
of the improvement ideas

106
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,110
from the identification
through final action.

107
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,240
So, as I said before,
you might sitting there;

108
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,040
and you come up with a great idea.

109
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,370
Well, if you just think about it

110
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,900
and nothing gets done, we're
never going to improve.

111
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,920
So instead, you should submit
that idea into the CIR,

112
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,850
the Continual Improvement Register.

113
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,600
From there, we'll log it in there.

114
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,010
And, eventually, we're going to figure out

115
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,490
whether or not we're going to
work on that improvement idea;

116
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:10,920
and if that improvement has a
low, medium, or high impact,

117
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,260
and what the resolution is.

118
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,830
Did we decide to do it or
did we not decide to do it?

119
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,070
And if we decide to do it,

120
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,440
when are we going to decide to do it?

121
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,980
And how are we going to plan for it?

122
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,370
So that's the whole idea.

123
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,070
Here's an example of a CIR.

124
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,170
Here you can see that there
are three different things

125
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,620
that are listed and the impact

126
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,140
for each one: medium, medium, and high.

127
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,310
And then the last column
there would be where we said

128
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,450
what we're going to do with it.

129
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,950
Yes, we're going to do this initiative,

130
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,850
and we're going to start it
in quarter one of next year.

131
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:36,960
Whatever that plan is,

132
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,050
we wanta make sure we're capturing it.

133
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,360
The last thing I wanta talk
about in continual improvement

134
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,250
is how it's operated when you talk

135
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,330
about continual improvement
with the relationships involved.

136
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,290
We like to put this in as a pyramid.

137
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,940
So if we start at the
bottom, and we start thinking

138
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,760
about our partners and
suppliers, how can we improve

139
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,960
our relationships with
partners and suppliers?

140
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,940
Well, we can do that by
going through and looking

141
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,330
at our contracts, including
how we're going to measure,

142
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,890
report, and improve those processes.

143
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,100
Then we look inside our
entire organization,

144
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,210
which is the next large
audience that we have.

145
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,630
And from there, we wanta try
to get active participation

146
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,220
and continual improvement initiatives

147
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,430
as a core part of everyone's job.

148
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,470
When it comes down to
it, continual improvement

149
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,840
isn't the job of the
continual improvement manager.

150
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,710
It's the job of everyone
in the organization.

151
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,380
And then we have the
continual improvement team led

152
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,190
by the continual improvement manager.

153
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,660
Their job is to lead
the efforts and advocate

154
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,490
for the practice across
the entire organization.

155
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,150
They're the ones trying
to get everyone else

156
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,070
in the organization to join in the fight

157
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,540
and help us improve.

158
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,570
And then all the way at
the top of the pyramid,

159
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,530
we have those few leaders at the top.

160
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,230
And those are going to be
the ones who going to try

161
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,470
to embed continual
improvement into the way

162
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:46,390
that people think and work by
providing that proper vision.

163
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,960
And so this really does hark back to

164
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,150
that continual improvement
model we talked about.

165
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,440
If we look at this pyramid
and we do it from the top

166
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,950
to the bottom instead, we
start seeing the leaders

167
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,250
who come up with the vision,
which is the beginning

168
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,910
of our continual improvement model.

169
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,940
Then we have our continual
improvement team,

170
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,440
and that team is the ones who are going

171
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,800
to be doing the baseline assessments

172
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,750
of where we are and
determining where we wanta be.

173
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,600
They're also going to
help develop the plans.

174
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,230
But then when we wanta take
action, we have to do that

175
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,040
with everyone in the organization
including our partners

176
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,190
and suppliers outside the organization.

177
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,250
And then we're going to
reassess where we are,

178
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,620
and then figure out how do
we keep this momentum going,

179
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,980
and do it all again.

180
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,780
You could see how this
all ties in together

181
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,620
time and time again.

182
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,530
Now, the last thing I
wanta talk about here

183
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,830
in continual improvement
is how it integrates

184
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,010
with the different value chain activities.

185
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,310
So if we look at how continual
improvement is going to work

186
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,620
inside plan, the continual
improvement practice is applied

187
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,150
to all planning activities.

188
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,690
We're going to look at
the methods and techniques

189
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,610
to make sure that they're all relevant

190
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,367
for the organization's current objective

191
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:46,920
in the context in which we're operating.

192
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,160
When we start looking at this
from the improve perspective,

193
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,050
the continual improvement practice is key

194
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,430
to this value chain activity.

195
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,920
It's all about improvement.

196
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,120
It structures our resources
and our activities

197
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,070
to enable that improvement at all levels

198
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:01,430
of the organization and across
the service value system.

199
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,820
Now as we look at the rest
of the service value chain,

200
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,100
and we look at the value chain activities

201
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,990
of engage, design and
transition, obtain and build,

202
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,380
and deliver and support,

203
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,580
each of these value chain
activities are subject

204
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,780
to continual improvement

205
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,060
because we're always trying
to improve our practices,

206
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,190
our activities, and our processes.

207
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,010
And the continual
improvement practice itself

208
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,450
is applied to all of these.

209
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,830
As you can see, the continual
improvement practice

210
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,660
is inside everything we do inside ITIL 4.

211
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,830
We're always trying to
continue to improve.

212
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,490
If we go back and look at the
service value chain again,

213
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,610
you see that improve touches
all of those inner cubes

214
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,400
and the engage process
with that purple line.

215
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,410
That's because it impacts
every single one of them.

216
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,670
That's the key here.

217
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,770
Continual improvement is
the key to our success

218
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,453
in ITIL 4 because we never
want to stop improving.
