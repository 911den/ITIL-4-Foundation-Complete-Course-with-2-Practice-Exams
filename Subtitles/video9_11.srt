1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,850
- Service Configuration Management.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,330
This is another practice you have to

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,030
recall the definition for.

4
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,130
The purpose of this service
configuration management

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,590
practice is to ensure
that accurate and reliable

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,080
information about the
configuration of services,

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,939
and the CIs known as configuration
items that support them,

8
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:19,400
is available when and where it's needed.

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,040
So when I think about this,
first we want to talk about,

10
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,500
what is a CI?

11
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,270
Well, a CI is any component
that needs to be managed

12
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,670
in order to deliver an IT service.

13
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,310
This might be a server,
it might be a switch.

14
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,800
It might be a desktop,
it might be a laptop.

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,280
All of these could be configuration items.

16
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,320
The way that we track these is as a single

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,060
configuration item like
your desktop computer

18
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,550
with Windows 10 and eight gigabytes of RAM

19
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,710
and a one terabyte hard
drive is a single CI,

20
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,140
in most cases, promotes your organization.

21
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,510
So, this is the idea here
that we have to think about

22
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,400
as we're tracking our service
configuration management.

23
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,800
Now, as we figure out what our

24
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,390
service configuration management is

25
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,931
and we know what all these CIs are

26
00:00:59,931 --> 00:01:00,764
and how they're configured,

27
00:01:00,764 --> 00:01:02,660
that means any time we want
to make a change to them

28
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,070
through change control,
this is going to feed back

29
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,020
into the service configuration management

30
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,470
so we can update our database

31
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,480
and know exactly what devices

32
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,430
and what assets we have all
throughout our organization

33
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,380
so we can get the most value from them.
