1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,790
- The continual improvement model.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,650
Now the continual improvement model

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,540
is a seven step methodology
that provides us

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,650
a framework of how we should
do improvement operations

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,740
within our organizations.

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,620
Now what we're going to do in this lesson

7
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,190
is focus on what those seven steps are

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,830
and then we're going to spend time

9
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,630
on each one of them individually

10
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,230
in their own lesson following this one.

11
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,250
So what is this model?

12
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,810
Well, it all starts out
with step number one.

13
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,400
What is the vision?

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,740
Then we move into step
two, where are we now?

15
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,270
Step three, where do we want to be?

16
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,780
Step four, how do we get there?

17
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,290
Step five, take action.

18
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,650
Step six, did we get there?

19
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,940
Step seven, how do we
keep this momentum going?

20
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,160
And then we restart it all again

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,480
because continual improvement

22
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,390
is an ongoing process that never stops.

23
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,200
We're going to continue
to go time and time again

24
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,710
until we get the best
product we ever can have.

25
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,580
And guess what, we're never
going to reach perfection.

26
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,070
There's always new features.

27
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,060
There's always better
ways of doing something.

28
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,320
And so by doing this
continual improvement,

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,290
we're constantly trying to get
better and better and better

30
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,940
to get to that ultimate vision,
that nirvana if you will,

31
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,210
but we're never quite going to reach it.

32
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,490
We'll talk about that
more in the next lesson

33
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,680
when we discuss what is the vision.

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,620
But for the exam, I wanted to
give you just this quick video

35
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,010
to go through these seven steps.

36
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,090
Why is that?

37
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,340
Because on the exam, you're going
to get questions about this.

38
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,700
They might describe one
of these seven steps

39
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,660
and you're going to have to pick

40
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,660
which of the seven steps it is.

41
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,060
They might say what comes next
after where do we want to be

42
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,530
and you're going to have
to say how do we get there.

43
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,180
You need to know these seven steps.

44
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,660
This is a memorization item for the exam.

45
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,570
But beyond memorizing them,

46
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,310
you need to understand
what these seven steps are

47
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,760
and that's why we're going to spend time

48
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,840
in the next seven lessons going through

49
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,423
each one individually.
