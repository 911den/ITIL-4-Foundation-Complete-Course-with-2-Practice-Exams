1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,420
- Collaborate and promote visibility.

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,980
This is our fourth guiding principle.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,130
Now, when we talk about
this, it's all about

4
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,550
collaborating across our staff

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,320
and even with our consumers
and our customers.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,900
When we have an initiative that involves

7
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,920
the right people in the correct roles,

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,450
we get a lot of benefit
from better buying,

9
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,990
more relevance, and increased

10
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,200
likelihood of long term success.

11
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,650
Collaboration is all
about working together.

12
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,140
We need to share information.

13
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,490
We need to build trust.

14
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,000
We need to build understanding.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,370
We need to understand that there's real

16
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,370
accomplishment that
can happen when we work

17
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,180
across the staff and get out of

18
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,160
our own little pigeon-hold silos.

19
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,620
For example, if I'm building a new service

20
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,065
and I want to build it all completely in

21
00:00:40,065 --> 00:00:43,470
the IT realm but it's going
to affect the marketing team,

22
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,920
that is not going to have
good long term success.

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,410
Instead, I should get people from

24
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,370
the marketing team to work with us

25
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,220
as we build this service for them.

26
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,430
Because that way we understand better what

27
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,520
their roles are and
their intended outcomes.

28
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,950
We understand the way
they're going to work

29
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,000
with with this service right?

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,530
And so by collaborating across

31
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,220
we're going to get a better product.

32
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,230
The other part of this is it's
going to increase visibility.

33
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,680
They're going to
understand where we are in

34
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,000
the development and so it's
going to make them happier

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,230
and be able to understand
exactly where we are.

36
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,890
And if we're hitting
our milestones, and if

37
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,142
we're going to get the product out in time

38
00:01:13,142 --> 00:01:15,050
to do what they need it.

39
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,439
We look at this there are people and

40
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,656
perspectives for successful collaboration

41
00:01:18,656 --> 00:01:21,500
across all of your stakeholder groups.

42
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,590
You alone do not have the right answers.

43
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,440
But when you work with everybody together

44
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,680
we do come up with better solutions.

45
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,530
This means that the service provider needs

46
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:30,940
to work with their customers.

47
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,450
The developers need to
work with Operations,

48
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,310
the suppliers need to work
with the organization.

49
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,020
All of these collaborations are

50
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,300
going to give us a better end product.

51
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,160
Now, if we don't have transparency and

52
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,720
we don't give good visibility,

53
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,110
what ends up happening?

54
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,900
Well, we start getting this impression

55
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,000
that work is not a priority.

56
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,057
For example, the people in marketing that

57
00:01:51,057 --> 00:01:53,140
I'm building this site for don't

58
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,600
necessarily know that I've got

59
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,550
50 other tasks that I'm working.

60
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,800
They're only tracking the one.

61
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,090
And they think theirs
is the most important.

62
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,080
And they might only want a
small improvement to their site.

63
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,410
Maybe they want to
change some font colors.

64
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,590
Well, is changing the
font colors more important

65
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,340
than fixing something that has been

66
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,100
down and is costing us money?

67
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,770
Well no, but they don't know that

68
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,920
because you're not being
transparent with them.

69
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,780
So by going through and showing them

70
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,480
and saying, "Hey I understand this is

71
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,020
your priority but it's not the

72
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,410
highest priority right now because

73
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,000
we have other more urgent tasks

74
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,280
that are being dealt with."

75
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,940
You got to be transparent this way.

76
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,080
Show people where your outages are.

77
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,040
Show them what you're working on and

78
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,530
give them an idea of when you're

79
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,630
going to get to their particular problem.

80
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,930
If you have an insufficient
amount of visibility

81
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,890
your work is going to lead
to poor decision making.

82
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,410
Because somebody above
you may not understand

83
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,630
what all the things are that
you're working on right?

84
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,680
And your boss comes in and says,

85
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,100
Hey the marketing director just came

86
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,810
and complained that the font is blue

87
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,000
but it should be green.

88
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,610
I need you to change that right now.

89
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,200
Drop everything you're doing."

90
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,430
And he might not even understand that

91
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,240
you're currently working
on a server outage

92
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,390
that's preventing your company from

93
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,130
being able to process
your credit card payments.

94
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,180
And that's costing you
say, $100,000 a day.

95
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,580
That would be more important to work on

96
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,550
than the green to blue font change right?

97
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,990
So this is the kind of idea of

98
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,130
things you need to think about.

99
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,434
Is making sure that everyone up and down

100
00:03:09,434 --> 00:03:11,721
and across has visibility into what

101
00:03:11,721 --> 00:03:14,000
the organization is working on.

102
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,690
This helps make sure everybody understands

103
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,580
the flow of work, they can identify the

104
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,970
bottlenecks and the excess
capacity that exists,

105
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,030
and we can uncover waste to make sure that

106
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,420
we're all working much more efficiently.

107
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,152
If you work in an agile development area

108
00:03:26,152 --> 00:03:29,180
you may have something like a Kanban Board

109
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,020
which shows everything that people are

110
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,530
working on at that time.

111
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,760
What work is in progress, what work needs

112
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,300
to be worked on, and what
work was already completed.

113
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,600
That's a great way to increase visibility.

114
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,810
Another agile technique
that I've seen used is

115
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,010
what's known and an
"Information Radiator."

116
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,520
This is a bog board in a central area that

117
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,360
shows the progress map of
what's being worked on,

118
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,220
the risks that we've identified,

119
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,730
the issues that have come up,

120
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,520
and other important information.

121
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,610
This is being fully transparent and

122
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,690
showing everybody what you have

123
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,030
and what you're working on.

124
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,410
This is the ultimate in
visibility and collaboration.

125
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,370
So, as we think about
the key takeaways here

126
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,640
from collaboration in visibility,

127
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,240
I want you to think about this,

128
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,570
Collaboration does not mean consensus.

129
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,075
Now, what do I mean by that statement?

130
00:04:14,075 --> 00:04:16,720
When it comes down to it
I want you to collaborate.

131
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,370
I want you to work as a team.

132
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,030
But at the end of the day,

133
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,970
somebody is in charge of this project.

134
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,850
Somebody is in charge of this service.

135
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,400
And that person gets
to make the decisions.

136
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,230
They should take any input
from everybody's suggestions.

137
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,400
But they're ultimately going to be the

138
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,750
ones making the decision.

139
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,540
And that's why
collaboration, communication,

140
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,880
and visibility is important.

141
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,854
Because that decision
maker is going to decide

142
00:04:37,854 --> 00:04:40,080
which trajectory and how we're going to

143
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,310
build that service is going to be done.

144
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,040
Next, I also want you to remember that

145
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,670
communicating is important and

146
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,840
you have to communicate in a
way that the audience can hear.

147
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,950
If I'm working with marketing folks

148
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,810
I'm not going to talk to
them about bits and bites,

149
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,150
and all the technical
details of the service.

150
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,130
Instead, we're going to talk
about outputs and outcomes.

151
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,940
What do they hope to get from the service?

152
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,950
What are they going to put in?

153
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,790
And what are they expecting to get out?

154
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:07,040
Talk to them in a way they
can hear and understand.

155
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,837
And finally, remember that decisions

156
00:05:08,837 --> 00:05:12,300
can only be made on the
visible parts of the project.

157
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,930
So if you don't have good visibility

158
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,300
and they don't understand all of your

159
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,130
pain points, all of your issues,

160
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,170
and all of your risks, then leadership

161
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,000
can't make the right decisions.

162
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,530
That's part of this
collaboration in visibility too.

163
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,700
Making sure the information is

164
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,190
getting up to the right people

165
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,593
at the right level to
make the right decisions.
