1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,320
- Incident management,
this is the next practice

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,870
we're going to talk about, and again,

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,120
it's one that you need to
know in depth for the exam.

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,680
The purpose of incident management

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,360
is to minimize the negative
impact of incidents

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,170
by restoring normal service operation

7
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,990
as quickly as possible.

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,420
Basically, what are you going
to do when something goes wrong?

9
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,790
Now, I mentioned there's a couple of terms

10
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:23,240
you have to memorize, and
here come our second term.

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,820
It's an incident.

12
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,640
An incident is an unplanned
interruption to a service

13
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,150
or reduction in the quality of a service.

14
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,110
Every incident needs to be logged,

15
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,810
managed to the agreed-upon
target resolution times,

16
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,510
and prioritized.

17
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,620
The way we design our
incident management practice

18
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,190
appropriately, is going to make sure

19
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,290
that we think about it
from different perspectives

20
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,610
with different incidents,

21
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,560
so I want to take my incidents
and I want to categorize them

22
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,460
based on the different impacts they have.

23
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,840
Is it a major incident
or a minor incident?

24
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,820
Is it an information security incident

25
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,820
or is it a management
and operations incident?

26
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,930
All of these are things
that we have to think about

27
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,410
as we're going through our
incident management practice.

28
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,750
Now, when it comes to
prioritizing our incidents,

29
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,720
I like to do it based on
an agreed classification.

30
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,210
Everyone should know what
that classification is.

31
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,430
Are we going to use high, medium and low?

32
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,750
Are we going to use a
one through five system?

33
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,720
Whatever it is, you need to know it,

34
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,940
your customers need to know it,

35
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,660
and everyone who supports
the systems needs to know it.

36
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,730
Also, we should have a way to say

37
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,130
what would categorize a high incident.

38
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,190
What would categorize a low incident?

39
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,530
Is it based on dollar time?

40
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,980
Is it based on the person's
position in the company?

41
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,140
Is it going to be based on
how much the thing costs?

42
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,390
Is it going to be based on how long

43
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,850
we think it's going to be down?

44
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,860
All of those are valid
ways to classify it.

45
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,070
It really depends on how your
organization decides to do it.

46
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,950
Also, when you're prioritizing incidents,

47
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,410
you need to ensure that your incidents

48
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,850
that have the highest business
impact are resolved first.

49
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,280
That means if it's something
that's affecting five users

50
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,880
or something that's
affecting 10,000 users,

51
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,110
we probably want to fix the thing

52
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,070
affecting 10,000 users first.

53
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,970
It has a higher business impact.

54
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,820
Or, if it's something that
may be a minor inconvenience

55
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,690
verus something that's costing you money,

56
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,560
you want to get the thing that
costs you money fixed first.

57
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,250
Now, when it comes to incident management,

58
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,400
you want to use a tool to log
and manage your incidents.

59
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,150
This is a way that you
can end up linking them

60
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,770
to configuration items,
to the different changes,

61
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,070
to the different problems,
known errors, and other things.

62
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,640
By having a good system,
it really does make

63
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,920
the knowledge management
piece a lot easier,

64
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,600
and helps you resolve
incidents much faster.

65
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,850
Another thing these can do for you

66
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,960
is they can provide incident
matching to other incidents,

67
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,950
other problems, and other known errors,

68
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,160
so for example, if you
call up and tell me,

69
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,430
hey, the wireless network
in the warehouse is down,

70
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,380
I can log that and it can say, oh,

71
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,560
we've already had three
other people call that in.

72
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,600
We know it's a problem
affecting a lot of users.

73
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,480
We should probably
raise the classification

74
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,330
from a low to a medium,
or a medium to a high.

75
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,910
Again, this is the benefit of having

76
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,100
a good incident management tool.

77
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,090
Incidents can also be escalated

78
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,970
for higher levels of support.

79
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,640
Oftentimes, your service
desk, who's your first person

80
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,970
who's taking in the incident,
isn't going to be the person

81
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,230
who's going to resolve it.

82
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,520
Instead, if they can't
solve it at their level,

83
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,300
they'll raise it to tier two support,

84
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,910
and if tier two can't do it,
it'll go to tier three support,

85
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,130
and you'll keep going up until
you get to the right level

86
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,270
of support to get that resolved.

87
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,970
This routing is typically
going to be based

88
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,720
on the incident's category.

89
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,260
Anyone working on an incident
should provide quality

90
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,580
and timely updates back into
this incident management system

91
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,730
because as we're going to talk
about in the service desk,

92
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,010
your service desk
analyst is the frontline.

93
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,860
They're going to be the ones
talking to the customer,

94
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,810
and when the customer says,
hey, is my ticket resolved yet?

95
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,810
They need to know about it.

96
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,050
If you've been working it and
you haven't been putting it

97
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,480
in the incident management system,

98
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,950
the analyst doesn't know the updates,

99
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,480
and the customer doesn't
get the communication.

100
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,080
Now, when we talk about
incident management,

101
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,980
I want you to remember
that incident management

102
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,360
requires a high level of collaboration

103
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,430
within and between the teams.

104
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,770
Like I was saying, if
you're solving the issue,

105
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,730
you need to tell that to the service desk.

106
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,740
You also need to work between your teams

107
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,200
and across your teams.

108
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,680
When we're working to diagnose
and resolve an incident,

109
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,400
your user might end up
using a self-help option.

110
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,890
They might use calling the
service desk as an option.

111
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,190
The service desk might
contact your support team,

112
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,380
your suppliers, or even your partners.

113
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,130
All of this is collaboration
and communication,

114
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,910
so we have to think about all
of this as we work through it.

115
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,140
And the other thing I want you to remember

116
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,520
is that some incidents can be very major

117
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,850
and some can be minor.

118
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,287
If you have a really major incident,

119
00:04:18,287 --> 00:04:19,710
one of the things you might want to do

120
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,020
is create a temporary
cross-functional team

121
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,600
to address that incident.

122
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,140
For example, maybe our website went down.

123
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,480
Well, I might want to get some
people from finance in here

124
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,670
'cause it's going to affect them,

125
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,860
some people from marketing,
'cause it affects them,

126
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,820
some people from sales,
'cause it affects them,

127
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,730
and then of course all
of our technical people,

128
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,910
so we can figure out how
we can create a workaround

129
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,700
and get this incident resolved
as quickly as possible.

130
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,780
In addition to all of
that, you may be doing

131
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,120
an incident response based on
a disaster recovery operation,

132
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,120
and if this is the case,

133
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,760
you want to bring in the
disaster recovery team as well,

134
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,380
because they know the plans and policies

135
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,870
of what we're going to do
to overcome that disaster.

136
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,290
All of this is going to depend
on your particular scenario

137
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,630
that you're involved
with in your incident.

138
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,080
Let me give you an example.

139
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,810
Maybe your organization is the victim

140
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,630
of a cyber attack or a
data breach that's ongoing.

141
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,820
What's the best way to
handle this scenario?

142
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,830
Well, if it was me and my company,

143
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,240
I might use a technique known as swarming.

144
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,520
This involves gathering
up different stakeholders

145
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,150
who initially all work together

146
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,640
until it becomes clear
which of them is best suited

147
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,210
to lead this effort
and solve the incident.

148
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,330
Once that occurs, we can
then release the others

149
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,680
back to their assigned tasks,

150
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,930
and the lead will take the charge of this.

151
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,800
Now, the reason we do this
is because it gives us

152
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,470
all of the people right away,

153
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,980
and this is really important
when you're dealing

154
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,110
with a major incident like a
cyber attack or a data breach.

155
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,190
I might not know exactly
where that person is

156
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,440
inside the network yet.

157
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,890
Are they dealing with the databases,

158
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,850
the file servers, the web servers?

159
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,880
I don't know, so I want people
from all of those teams here

160
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,200
working with me, that's
what we call swarming,

161
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,830
and then once we figure out,
oh, it was a database breach,

162
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,540
then we can let the web guys
go and the file server guys go,

163
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,110
and we'll still work
with the database team.

164
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,730
That's the way we want
to do this kind of stuff.

165
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,710
It's the way that we're trying

166
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,103
to figure out how we can
best solve our incidents.

167
00:05:59,103 --> 00:06:00,810
When we think about incidents,

168
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,020
I want you to think about the fact

169
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,150
that it heavily relies on collaboration

170
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,560
to facilitate information
sharing and learning,

171
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,140
as well as helping to solve the incident

172
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,340
more efficiently and more effectively.

173
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,920
That's what we're trying to do.

174
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,370
So, when we think about this

175
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,150
through our value chain activity lens,

176
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,660
which ones are going to be affected?

177
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,390
Well, let's start with improve.

178
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,510
When we're talking about improve,

179
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,100
we're going to be thinking
about the incident records

180
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,730
in our incident management system.

181
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,410
These are a key input to
our improve activities.

182
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,520
If we can go in there
and find the frequency

183
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,100
and severity of different incidents,

184
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,750
we can figure out where we
need to put more resources,

185
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,950
time or money to improve ourselves.

186
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,170
Now, if we consider this
from the engage activity,

187
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,240
we have to think about the fact

188
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,750
that incidents are visible to everyone.

189
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,130
Your users are going to know about it,

190
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,820
and your customers are
going to know about it,

191
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,160
so we're going to have to engage with them

192
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,480
and let them know ahead of time

193
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,110
how we're solving these problems,

194
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,750
and the fact that we
know that it's a problem

195
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,530
and that we're going to overcome it.

196
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,350
When we think about this
from design and transition,

197
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,070
if we have an incident, it might occur

198
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,710
in a test environment,
which happens during design.

199
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,080
It might also happen during
the release and deployment,

200
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,680
which is part of transition.

201
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,930
Either way, we want to make sure

202
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,910
the incident management practice is there

203
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,170
to help us ensure the
incidents are resolved

204
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,340
in a timely and controlled manner.

205
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,730
When we think about this from
an obtain/build perspective,

206
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,770
we want to think about the
fact that incidents occur

207
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,500
in development environments too, right?

208
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,250
And so as I'm obtaining and
building things, things break.

209
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,110
How are we going to solve those problems?

210
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,570
The incident management
practice has things in place

211
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,810
to help us with those as well,
because we want to make sure

212
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,760
we're figuring those things out early

213
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,430
before we move it into transition,

214
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,270
and then from transition
over to deliver and support,

215
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,230
which brings us to deliver and support.

216
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,570
Deliver and support is
where we spend a lot of time

217
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,160
in incident management, because this is

218
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,170
a significant contributor
to supporting our users.

219
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,930
Deliver and support's value chain activity

220
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,600
includes the resolving of
incidents and problems,

221
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,660
identifying them, solving them,

222
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,550
and communicating that back to the user.

223
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,800
Again, that goes back
into our engage again.

224
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,960
So, as we're talking, all
of this is really important

225
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,260
inside incident management.

226
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,940
How do we identify, diagnose,
and solve all these problems

227
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,120
as quickly and efficiently as possible?

228
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,770
That's what it all comes down to.
