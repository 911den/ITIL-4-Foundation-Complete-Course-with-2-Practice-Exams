1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,920
- Partners and suppliers,
this is our third dimension.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,500
Now, partners and suppliers
are really organizations

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,500
and people, but they're not going to fit

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,740
under dimension one.

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,110
The reason is we talk about organizations

6
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,240
and people who are internally focused.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,770
We're looking at our
company and our organization

8
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,410
and the people that support it.

9
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,940
When we talk about partners and suppliers

10
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,716
we're talking about things external to us.

11
00:00:21,716 --> 00:00:24,022
Now, the other question
that comes up often,

12
00:00:24,022 --> 00:00:26,952
is why do I have to call
it partners and suppliers?

13
00:00:26,952 --> 00:00:28,284
Aren't they one and the same?

14
00:00:28,284 --> 00:00:30,950
Well, no, there's a
difference between people

15
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,160
who are your partners and
people who are your suppliers.

16
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,989
And we'll talk about that in this lesson.

17
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:37,032
First, let's consider this.

18
00:00:37,032 --> 00:00:39,999
There are the service provider
and the service consumer

19
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:41,710
and they have that relationship.

20
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,688
We talk about that back in section two.

21
00:00:43,688 --> 00:00:45,680
When we talk about that,
there are some people

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,770
who are consuming something

23
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,800
and somebody who is providing that.

24
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,504
Now, in our organization, we
may be the service provider

25
00:00:51,504 --> 00:00:54,470
and we're selling things
to our customers, right?

26
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,720
Or our consumers.

27
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,221
But we're probably also taking things in

28
00:00:58,221 --> 00:01:01,464
that we're going to use and in
that case we're the consumer

29
00:01:01,464 --> 00:01:04,210
and the somebody else
is our service provider.

30
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,660
That might be a partner of ours

31
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,166
or it might be a supplier of ours.

32
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:10,350
Now, whether you're going to
use a partner or a supplier,

33
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,852
is going to depend on your
organization strategy.

34
00:01:12,852 --> 00:01:15,000
You're going to think
about is this something

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,400
that is critical to
our business and if so,

36
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,990
you probably need it more
as a partner relationship.

37
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,600
If it's something that's not as critical,

38
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,890
it might be in the supplier relationship.

39
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,225
Well, let me give you an example of this.

40
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:29,780
My company is in partnership
with PeopleCert and AXELOS.

41
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,700
Now, PeopleCert is the people
who are going to test you

42
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,190
for the ITIL exam and
AXELOS are the people

43
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,880
who write the exam and
all of the text books.

44
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,710
Because of our partnership with them,

45
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,262
we get access to the text books
about six months to a year

46
00:01:41,262 --> 00:01:43,450
before they're available for students.

47
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,750
That gives us time to get them, read them,

48
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,060
learn all the information

49
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,960
and then build all the practice exams

50
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,530
and the courses for you.

51
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,305
Also we get all the
objectives ahead of time.

52
00:01:53,305 --> 00:01:55,130
All of the stuff is things

53
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,970
that AXELOS and PeopleCert provide to us

54
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,340
as part of our partnership.

55
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,250
And because we are aligned
with them in this partnership,

56
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,650
we get all these critical
business functions

57
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:08,100
and we get input into them
and they get input back to us.

58
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,500
That's a partnership.

59
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,772
Now if I look at a supplier
relationship on the other hand,

60
00:02:11,772 --> 00:02:14,368
my company has a bunch or
printers in our office.

61
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:16,736
Now if you want to get
some paper for the printer,

62
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:19,410
or you want to get some ink
and toner for the printer,

63
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,570
that's a supplier.

64
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,790
I'm going to go up on Amazon,
I'm going to order some stuff,

65
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,660
Amazon's going to drop
it on the front door

66
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,970
and we're now going to
have paper and toner

67
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,390
and staplers and things
like that for the company.

68
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,950
I don't need to know what
Amazon's going to be doing

69
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,500
in the next six months to be able

70
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,030
to make sure that supply order
is going to continue to go on.

71
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,540
Because if Amazon stops doing
printer and toner and ink,

72
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,940
I can just pick somebody else to do it.

73
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,250
It's a commodity.

74
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,010
But if AXELOS decide that
they were going to turn off

75
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,901
the ITIL certification, and
no longer offer it anymore,

76
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,230
that's something that's very
critical to our business,

77
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,780
and we need to know about it.

78
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,710
So that's the difference
between this partnership

79
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,440
and a supplier relationship.

80
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,690
With a partner you have a lot more buy in,

81
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,550
you have a lot more two way communication.

82
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,417
You might share plans and road maps.

83
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:03,621
For example, AXELOS has already told us,

84
00:03:03,621 --> 00:03:06,741
when the next part of the
ITIL certification comes out,

85
00:03:06,741 --> 00:03:08,720
the foundation is the first level.

86
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,609
And then there are five other exams

87
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:12,918
that allow you to get up
to being an ITIL Master.

88
00:03:12,918 --> 00:03:14,890
We already have the roadmap and know

89
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,000
when those are going to happen,

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,741
so we can build all those
products to that partnership.

91
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:20,950
With a supplier I don't know

92
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,700
if Amazon's going to change the type

93
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,340
of paper they're going
to supply next week,

94
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,420
but I really don't care.

95
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,000
As long as it's eight and a half by eleven

96
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,650
and it's white and it goes in the printer,

97
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,110
that's fine by me, right?

98
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,160
It's a big difference when
you're dealing with a partnership

99
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,760
versus a supplier.

100
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,636
Now, this is going to influence
your supplier strategy.

101
00:03:36,636 --> 00:03:38,410
You're going to have to think about,

102
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,080
do I care about price most?

103
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,496
Do I care about quality most?

104
00:03:41,496 --> 00:03:43,440
Do I care about being
able to exchange it out

105
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,550
with different people?

106
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,330
Let me give you a couple
of examples of this.

107
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,511
Let's say you're building your technology

108
00:03:47,511 --> 00:03:49,356
and you're going to build a new website.

109
00:03:49,356 --> 00:03:51,301
You decide you're going
to host it on the Cloud.

110
00:03:51,301 --> 00:03:53,796
There's three major providers
for Cloud right now.

111
00:03:53,796 --> 00:03:56,884
You have Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure

112
00:03:56,884 --> 00:04:00,970
and Amazon's AWS service,
the Amazon Web Services.

113
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,540
You can use any of those three.

114
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,334
They're all fairly equivalent, right?

115
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:06,946
But you need to understand
when you pick one,

116
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:08,870
that it's pretty painful to have to move

117
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,040
from one to the other.

118
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,570
And so you probably want to pick one

119
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,940
with a long term strategy
of staying with it.

120
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,040
Because once you pick one,

121
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,534
you're going to get your staff
trained to that certifications.

122
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:20,260
So if I'm going to go with
Microsoft, I'm going to get a bunch

123
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,869
of my folks Azure qualified.

124
00:04:21,869 --> 00:04:24,794
If I go with Amazon, I'm going
to get the AWS certified, right?

125
00:04:24,794 --> 00:04:27,090
And we're going to build
ourself around that strategy.

126
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,346
It's not as easy moving from Azure to AWS

127
00:04:30,346 --> 00:04:34,650
as it is to go from HP paper
to Boston paper, right?

128
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,710
Paper is paper, it still
fits in the printer.

129
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,030
And so there's a different
level of supplier there.

130
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,730
But it's still a supplier.

131
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,460
You're not going to
necessarily have a partnership

132
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,710
with AWS where they're going
to give you their roadmap

133
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,960
for the next five years.

134
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,758
That's not the level of
partnership you have.

135
00:04:47,758 --> 00:04:50,060
And so these are going to be
some of the different factors

136
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,990
that are going to affect
whether you're going to be

137
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,440
more of a commodity based
and look for the lowest price

138
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,414
like you might for ink
and toner and paper,

139
00:04:56,414 --> 00:04:57,990
or if you're going to be looking

140
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,900
at other factors that have impact,

141
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,758
such as reliability,
quality, track record.

142
00:05:02,758 --> 00:05:04,370
If I'm going for a web provider,

143
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,594
those are things I care about,

144
00:05:05,594 --> 00:05:07,290
or all the way on the other side,

145
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,238
we have those partnerships,
where we're fully involved

146
00:05:09,238 --> 00:05:11,260
with the long term goals

147
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,078
and strategies of that organization.

148
00:05:13,078 --> 00:05:15,890
Now, the last thing I
want to talk about here,

149
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,237
is this concept of a service integration.

150
00:05:18,237 --> 00:05:20,550
Now, with service
integration, a lot of times,

151
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,738
you're going to have a lot of
different things out there.

152
00:05:22,738 --> 00:05:24,700
If I look at the service that I use

153
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,590
to be able to provide my videos to you,

154
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,323
I have a video service out
there, I have a store front,

155
00:05:29,323 --> 00:05:32,400
I have a website, we have Cloud hosting,

156
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,580
we've got five or six different things,

157
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,740
that we have to tie together to make sure,

158
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,440
that we deliver the videos to you,

159
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,250
the way that you want to get them.

160
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,930
Now, we do that all internally,

161
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,770
because we want to make
sure it's done right.

162
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,520
And because it's a reasonable number,

163
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,218
four or five or six different services.

164
00:05:47,218 --> 00:05:49,274
But if you're in a very large company,

165
00:05:49,274 --> 00:05:51,494
you might have a lot
of different suppliers.

166
00:05:51,494 --> 00:05:53,550
I worked in one organization,

167
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,690
where we have thousands
of different suppliers,

168
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,650
because we had a hundred
thousand employees,

169
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,825
it was a huge organization.

170
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,150
And so we didn't want to have to deal

171
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,980
with all of those people individually.

172
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,802
Instead, we hired a third party,
called a service integrator

173
00:06:05,802 --> 00:06:09,210
and it was their job to
do all of the management

174
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,920
of all of those suppliers for us.

175
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,330
And so we would pay the integrator
and they would reach out

176
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,110
to all those different organizations

177
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,940
and manage those relationships for us

178
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,327
and make sure we got
the products we needed

179
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:21,026
at the time we needed and
the delivery we needed.

180
00:06:21,026 --> 00:06:22,460
And so if you're going to integrate

181
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,960
in a bunch of different services

182
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,400
and a bunch of different suppliers,

183
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,178
those service integrators
can really be helpful.

184
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:30,014
So to summarize
partnerships and suppliers.

185
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,610
When we talk about partnerships,

186
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,260
this is where you're going
to share common goals

187
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,920
and risks with the partner.

188
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,880
You're going to collaborate

189
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,586
to achieve the desired outcomes you want

190
00:06:37,586 --> 00:06:40,520
and you're going to make sure
that you're both in it together.

191
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,778
So in the example of
AXELOS and PeopleCert,

192
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:45,418
and DION training, we're
all in it together.

193
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:47,534
I AXELOS starts not selling exams,

194
00:06:47,534 --> 00:06:49,422
because their brand goes down,

195
00:06:49,422 --> 00:06:51,877
then employers don't want
people to get certified in it

196
00:06:51,877 --> 00:06:53,660
and that hurts my business as well.

197
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,440
And so we're all in it
together to make sure

198
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,040
that the brand stays good,
the employers still want it

199
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,030
and that ITIL is still valuable.

200
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,450
Now, when we start talking about
suppliers on the other hand

201
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,680
we're talking about
goods and service, right?

202
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,500
This can be done through formal contracts.

203
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,426
There's a clear separation
of responsibilities.

204
00:07:08,426 --> 00:07:10,550
I pay X amount of dollars

205
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,500
and I get X amount of band width.

206
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,250
Or I get X amount of Cloud space,

207
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,093
or I get X amount of reams of paper.

208
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:18,750
Whatever those things
are, that's all handled

209
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,533
through contracting
and it's a deliverable.

210
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:23,770
I pay you for this, you
do this amount of work.

211
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,310
When you outsource a function,

212
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,441
that's considered a
supplier, not a partnership.

213
00:07:28,441 --> 00:07:31,466
Now, every organization and
every service is going to depend

214
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:34,230
on some extent on other organizations.

215
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,240
Whether they're partners or suppliers.

216
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,520
There is nothing you
can do that you're doing

217
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,300
without any other partners out there.

218
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,910
Something out there is doing it.

219
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,020
That might be that you have
a supplier like Microsoft

220
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,670
that provides you Microsoft office

221
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,680
when you pay a fee.

222
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,640
It might be your internet
service provider,

223
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,410
who you're paying a
monthly fee to get online

224
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,330
to do your business.

225
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,550
Whatever it is, there
is something out there

226
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,637
that is part of this
partners and suppliers.

227
00:07:55,637 --> 00:07:58,637
And a lot of times there are
a lot of these somethings

228
00:07:58,637 --> 00:08:01,450
which is Service
Integration and Management.

229
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,900
Service Integration and
Management involves the use

230
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,500
of specially established
integrators to ensure

231
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,185
that the service relationships
are properly coordinated.

232
00:08:09,185 --> 00:08:11,010
Now what does that mean?

233
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,090
Well if you think about it, there's a lot

234
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,357
of different moving pieces here.

235
00:08:14,357 --> 00:08:17,260
If I go and look at my
website for example,

236
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,010
I have the website that has
to be coded by a programmer.

237
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,880
I have the graphics
that need to be added on

238
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,250
by a graphic designer.

239
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,300
I have somebody who needs to
host this with a web server.

240
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,367
I have the videos hosted on
a different video server.

241
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:30,633
I have somebody who does
the credit card processing.

242
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:33,737
We've got five or six or seven
different suppliers involved

243
00:08:33,737 --> 00:08:37,350
just to be able to run a
simple E-Commerce website.

244
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,280
And probably more than that

245
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,617
if I started listing them all out.

246
00:08:39,617 --> 00:08:42,590
Well, we can either do the
service integration internal

247
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,120
to the organization, meaning
that I can go and work

248
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,720
with all of these individual vendors

249
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,720
to make sure the product works properly,

250
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,900
or I can outsource that
to a service integration

251
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,060
and management person.

252
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,693
And if I hire a service integrator,

253
00:08:54,693 --> 00:08:56,810
they'll do all of that for me.

254
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,560
So I can contract to them,

255
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,130
they can go out to all of
those third party vendors,

256
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,260
get it all working

257
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,510
and then just bring me
back the results I want.

258
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,990
In that case they become
a service provider to me,

259
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,670
doing service integration and
I become the service consumer,

260
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,600
consuming the service that
I just outsourced to them.

261
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,273
Now, should you use a service integrator?

262
00:09:15,273 --> 00:09:18,480
Well, that depends on your
organization strategy.

263
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,260
Your strategy when it comes to partners

264
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,660
and suppliers and integrators
is all going to be based

265
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,930
on your goals, your culture
and your business environment.

266
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,030
There's a lot of different
things going on out there

267
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,390
and figuring out what
your supplier strategy is,

268
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,870
is something that's going to help.

269
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,009
For the exam though, you
just need to remember

270
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:36,510
that we have partners and suppliers.

271
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,210
Partners are more closely
tied into our business.

272
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,550
Suppliers tend to be
more commoditized things.

273
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,380
And if you can keep that straight,

274
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,823
you'll do great on the exam.
