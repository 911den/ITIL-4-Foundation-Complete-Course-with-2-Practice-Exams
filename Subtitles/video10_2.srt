1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:02,430
- Deployment Management.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,800
This is a recall level of
difficulty for the exam.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,060
The purpose of the Deployment
Management practice

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,130
is to move new or changed
hardware, software,

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,180
documentation, processes,
or other components

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,820
to the live environment.

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,830
It may also be involved
with deploying components

8
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,590
to other environments
for testing or staging.

9
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,540
Basically, we used to have
release and deployment

10
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,430
as one practice but in ITIL 4,

11
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,170
release and deployment are
now two different things.

12
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,160
Release is more focused
on the approval process,

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,100
where deployment is more
about moving the change over

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,640
into the live environment.

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,060
And so that's what we're going to focus on

16
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,800
inside deployment management.

17
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,680
As I build a new server or
I build a new capability,

18
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,410
it's going to go through
the change process,

19
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,620
it's going to get approval,

20
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,680
it'll go through the
release management process,

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,560
and eventually, it will get deployed

22
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,720
through deployment management

23
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,150
and move itself from transition into

24
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,993
the deliver and support perspective.
