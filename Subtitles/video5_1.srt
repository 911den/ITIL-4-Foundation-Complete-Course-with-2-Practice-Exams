00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,840
- The Guiding Principles.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,210
In this section of the course,

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,940
we're going to take a look at
the seven guiding principles

4
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,260
in ITIL 4.

5
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,220
Now this is important because on the exam

6
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,040
there are two exam objectives
that are going to cover

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,830
these seven guiding principles.

8
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,660
The first is to describe the nature,

9
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,630
use, and interaction of these
seven guiding principles.

10
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,160
And the second objective
is to explain the use

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,400
of these seven different
guiding principles.

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,990
And this is important
because we're not going to

13
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,630
have to memorize those guiding
principles necessarily,

14
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,390
or figure out what their definition is.

15
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,070
But we're actually
going to have to explain

16
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,330
and describe, which is a
level two level of effort

17
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,560
inside the exam.

18
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,980
So if I give you a scenario and I explain

19
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,680
what one of these guiding principles is,

20
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,320
you should be able to pick out and say

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,500
this guiding principle
relates to that scenario.

22
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,410
Now, before we go and dig into all of that

23
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:48,700
we have to go and think about

24
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,630
what is a guiding principle?

25
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,350
Well, a guiding principle
is a a recommendation

26
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,030
that's going to guide an organization

27
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,880
in all circumstances.

28
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,700
That's right, guiding
principles can be used

29
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,740
to guide an organization in their work

30
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,830
as they adopt a service
management approach

31
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:06,120
and adapt ITIL guidance to
their own specific needs

32
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,650
and circumstances.

33
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,180
This means that all organizations
are going to integrate

34
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,120
the use of multiple different methods

35
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,600
into their overall approach
to service management.

36
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,960
The way you do service management

37
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,710
and the way I do service
management might be different.

38
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,930
But, we both should be based
on the same guiding principles.

39
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,240
Because these guiding principles
are applied universally

40
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,290
to every initiative out there.

41
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,740
Now when we talk about applying
those guiding principles,

42
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,300
these guiding principles
are going to help us

43
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,600
to encourage and support our organizations

44
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,130
in their continual
improvement across all levels

45
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,580
of the organization.

46
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,420
These, as I said, are applied universally

47
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,206
to all of the initiatives, but also

48
00:01:42,206 --> 00:01:44,410
to all of the relationships
with your different

49
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,640
stake holder groups.

50
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,520
So as we talk about the consumers

51
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,720
and the customers and the stake holders

52
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,490
across the organization,
all of these people

53
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,210
need to be considered when you're thinking

54
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,070
about these guiding principles.

55
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,060
For example, the first guiding principle

56
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,230
is known as focus on value.

57
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,034
Now with focus on value it
can, and should be applied,

58
00:02:03,034 --> 00:02:05,060
to all of your relevant stake holders

59
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,090
and respective definitions of value.

60
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,870
We're not going to just consider the value

61
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,300
for the consumer, but we
also want to look at it

62
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,400
from the value for the customer.

63
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,190
We want to look at it for the value

64
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,455
for the service provider.

65
00:02:16,455 --> 00:02:17,990
All of those different people

66
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,648
and stake holders need to be getting value

67
00:02:19,648 --> 00:02:21,700
from whatever the service is we're doing.

68
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,950
And so that's a way that
we look at this stuff,

69
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,590
for example as we're looking at the focus

70
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,340
on value principle.

71
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,860
Now, as an organization
I'm not going to use

72
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,730
just one or two of these principles.

73
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,800
But I should consider all seven of them,

74
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,600
and determine which ones are relevant

75
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,690
for each situation and
how I should apply them.

76
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,520
Not all of the principles
are going to be critical

77
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,880
in every situation.

78
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,640
But you're probably
going to find that five

79
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,450
or six, or even seven of them,

80
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,220
may apply to your initiative.

81
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,150
And so you want to think
through each of them,

82
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,420
kind of like a check list,
to make sure you're thinking

83
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,090
about your service in a holistic way.

84
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,240
As you do this and you
review each of them,

85
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,280
you have a way to determine whether or not

86
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,980
they're appropriate for your service

87
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,610
and should it be applied.

88
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,650
Now, I mentioned a lot about
these guiding principles

89
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,440
so far but I haven't even
told you what they are.

90
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,070
Well, throughout the rest of this section

91
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,720
we're going to focus on the
seven guiding principles.

92
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,800
The first is focus on value.

93
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,910
The second is start where you are.

94
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,930
The third is progress
iteratively and with feedback.

95
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,438
The fourth is to collaborate
and promote visibility.

96
00:03:20,438 --> 00:03:23,386
The fifth is to think
and work holistically.

97
00:03:23,386 --> 00:03:26,096
The sixth is to keep it
simple and practical.

98
00:03:26,096 --> 00:03:29,900
And finally our seventh one
is to optimize and automate.

99
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,880
So, let's get started looking

100
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,503
at our seven guiding principles.
