1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,550
- The next practice we're going to discuss

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,720
is Service Financial Management.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,500
Now, service financial management, again,

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,540
is one that's just for
your general knowledge.

5
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,540
It's not covered on the exam.

6
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,250
This practice is focused on
supporting the organization

7
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,890
strategies and plans
for service management.

8
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,180
It does this by ensuring
that the organization's

9
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,310
financial resources and their investments

10
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,180
are being used effectively.

11
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,470
So if you've ever decided
to make the recommendation

12
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,490
to your boss that we should
go and buy X, Y, Z system

13
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,600
or X, Y, Z software product
and install it in our system,

14
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,177
at some point, he's probably asked you,

15
00:00:32,177 --> 00:00:35,290
"Well, how much is it going
to cost and is it worth it?"

16
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,440
Service Financial Management
is that whole backend process

17
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,140
to verify that we have enough money

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,950
to buy the things that you want to get

19
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,040
and that what you want to
get is going to give us a

20
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,460
good return on our investment
so that we can actually

21
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,330
use our capital in the most effective way.

22
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,970
There's a ton of things that we can buy

23
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,460
with our organization's money.

24
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,520
We want to make sure
we're doing it responsibly

25
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,480
and that we're going to get
the best bang for our buck.

26
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,380
Service Financial Management
is all of those backend things

27
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,650
that the accountants are going to do

28
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,380
and the business analysts are going to do

29
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,885
to ensure that our company
remains financially solvent

30
00:01:05,885 --> 00:01:08,160
and that we're able to continue operating

31
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,070
because we have money
to pay our employees,

32
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,310
pay for our services,
pay for our contract,

33
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,763
and keep the business afloat.
