1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,900
- Monitoring and event management.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,750
This is another one you have
to recall the purpose of

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,000
and there's a term that were
going to have to define.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,610
Let's start with the purpose.

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,330
The purpose of monitoring
an event management practice

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,940
is to systematically observe

7
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,950
a service or a service component,

8
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,000
and record and report
selected changes of state

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,890
identified as events.

10
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,330
And events is the word that
we're going to have to define.

11
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,910
Now this practice identifies
and prioritizes infrastructure,

12
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,600
services, business processes,
information security events,

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,740
and then it establishes

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,750
the appropriate response to those events,

15
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,380
including responding to the conditions

16
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,280
that could lead to potential
faults or incidents.

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,820
Event management is
really important for us.

18
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,490
And this brings us to the
term that we need to memorize.

19
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,570
This one is called an event.

20
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,340
An event is any change of
state that has significance

21
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,470
for the management of a configuration item

22
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,470
or a CI or an IT service.

23
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,550
For example, an event might be
when you log in successfully,

24
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,110
or when you fail to log in successfully.

25
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,920
It might be that the bandwidth is exceeded

26
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,170
for a certain threshold.

27
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,180
It might be that the
free space on a server

28
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,000
gets below a certain threshold.

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,090
These are all things that could be events.

30
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,960
We want to make sure
that we take some action

31
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,900
based on these events.

32
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,690
And depending on what the event is,

33
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,690
that's going to tell
us what we need to do.

34
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,180
The event might be something
that's informational,

35
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,120
or it might be a warning,
or it might be an alert,

36
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,600
depending on the severity.

37
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,860
If it's something informational,

38
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,290
like we had a successful
login, that's fine,

39
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,040
we don't have to take any
action, we might just log it.

40
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,930
But if we have something
like a login failure

41
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,580
that happened three times,
that might become a warning

42
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,480
and we want to figure
out why did that account

43
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,590
try to log in three times incorrectly.

44
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,710
If we have something like
the free space on a server

45
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,500
gets below 10 gigabytes,
that might be an alert

46
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,130
because it might cause a server to crash

47
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,740
if we run out of disk space.

48
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,350
That's the idea here with
the event and monitoring.

49
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,520
We want to make sure we
understand what events there are,

50
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,860
and we monitor them to decide
what actions need to be taken.

51
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,620
Some of those actions need to go out

52
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,950
and get into the problem
management perspective,

53
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,840
or the incident management perspective.

54
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,480
But again, here inside
of the event monitoring,

55
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,100
we're really focused on the event,

56
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,410
which is any change in
state that has significance

57
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,280
for the management of
a configuration item,

58
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,243
a CI, or an IT service.
