1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,720
- Capacity and performance management.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,470
This is another one that
you don't need to know

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,440
for the foundation level exam.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,800
But we're going to cover it so
you have a good understanding,

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,410
because it is one you're
going to run across

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,270
inside the real world.

7
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,850
So, the purpose of capacity

8
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,560
and performance management practice

9
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,180
is to ensure that services
achieve the agreed-upon

10
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,800
and expected performance,

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,020
satisfies the current and future demand

12
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,910
in a cost-effective way.

13
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,210
When we talk about performance,

14
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,440
this is a measure of what's
achieved by delivering a system,

15
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,320
a person, a team, a practice or a service

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,310
to do some sort of function.

17
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,690
So, if I'm talking about
service performance,

18
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,020
this is associated with a
number of service actions

19
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,800
performed in a given timeframe,

20
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,290
and the time to fill that service action

21
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,120
at a given level of demand.

22
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,800
Going back to my voucher example,

23
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,250
when you order a voucher,

24
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,700
our service performance metric

25
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,290
is that you have it in your
hand within ten minutes.

26
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,550
That's really quick, right?

27
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,100
Generally you're going to get
it in less than 30 seconds,

28
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,870
but sometimes it's a little longer.

29
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,150
Now, when we talk about
capacity, on the other hand,

30
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,650
and we look at our service capacity,

31
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,510
this is the maximum throughput
that a configuration item

32
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,080
or service can deliver.

33
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,060
So, if I'm talking about the
capacity of your hard drive,

34
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,950
it's how much data you can store.

35
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,040
If I'm talking about the capacity

36
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,310
of your network connection,

37
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,690
it's how fast it is.

38
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,510
Is it 100 megabits per second?

39
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,310
Is it one gigabit per second?

40
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,530
Whatever it happens to be,

41
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,310
that would be your maximum throughput

42
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,250
for that configuration item.

43
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,900
Now, as we go through and
we look at our capacity

44
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,330
and our performance management,

45
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,060
this is where a lot of the
metrics come into place.

46
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,760
If you're working in a technical realm

47
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,710
and you're measuring server capacity

48
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,010
and server performance,

49
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,620
there's going to be lots of different
metrics you're going to get.

50
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,020
I want to warn you again,

51
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,740
don't just measure the outputs,

52
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,289
measure the outcomes.

53
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:44,220
What is important of all these
metrics and measurements?

54
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,590
Why are we measuring them?

55
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,330
What are we hoping to achieve?

56
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,729
Often times in capacity
and performance management,

57
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:52,330
people lose sight of the bigger picture

58
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:55,140
and they focus so hard
on the individual metrics

59
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,370
of capacity and performance
that it becomes useless.

60
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,890
So, I want to warn you against that,

61
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,930
but in the real world
you are going to run into

62
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,200
capacity and performance management a lot,

63
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,230
especially if you're
a system administrator

64
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,500
or a network administrator.

65
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,370
Because those are things
that, you're trying to meet

66
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,214
those particular standards
inside capacity and performance

67
00:02:12,214 --> 00:02:13,883
to meet the metrics you're given.
