1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,250
- As I stated in the last
section of this course,

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,720
ITIL is a framework for
information technology

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,840
service management, known as ITSM.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,630
According to ITIL Four,
service management is defined

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,630
as a set of specialized
organizational capabilities

6
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,920
for enabling value to customers
in the form of services.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,550
Whenever we speak about
organizational capability,

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,840
such as in this definition
of service management,

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,700
this is referring to an organization

10
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,240
having both the capacity and the ability,

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,460
to perform the functions required.

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,600
Service management, whether
you're performing it

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,140
using ITIL Four as it's framework,

14
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,960
or another ITSM framework,

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,960
is focused on how to best create value

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,480
within an organization,

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,590
to provide the desired
benefits to your consumers.

18
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,110
Now, to do that, an organization
must organize it's people

19
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,384
to best support the
organization's activities,

20
00:00:47,384 --> 00:00:49,660
practices and processes.

21
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,160
These activities, practices and processes,

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,970
are the engine that drive the creation

23
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,070
of the organization's
products and their services.

24
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,400
But, none of these activities,
practices and processes,

25
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,110
could be done in isolation.

26
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,990
Instead, we have to consider
the service relationships

27
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:07,270
that are built, created and nurtured

28
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,650
throughout the service management process.

29
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,970
In this section of the course,

30
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,210
we're going to discuss
these generalized concepts

31
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,820
of service management, that
apply to both ITIL Four

32
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,290
and other frameworks.

33
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,010
Then, we're going to spend a bit of time

34
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,980
going over the concepts of outcomes,

35
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,250
risks, utility and warranty,

36
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,160
to help build a solid foundation,

37
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,850
before we move in to the
specific ITIL Four concepts,

38
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,170
that are covered throughout
the rest of this course.

39
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,670
Now remember, even though
the concepts in this section

40
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,690
are generalized for IT service management,

41
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,760
it doesn't mean they won't
be on the ITIL Four exam.

42
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,120
In fact, we're going to cover

43
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,450
all three parts of Learning Objective One,

44
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,250
in this section of the course.

45
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,550
This includes Learning
Objective one point one,

46
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,890
which states that you're
going to have to be able to

47
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,430
recall the definition of
service, utility, warranty,

48
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,010
customer, user, service
management and sponsor.

49
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,750
You can also expect to get two questions

50
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,740
from this learning objective,
on your certification exam.

51
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,600
Under Learning Objective one point two,

52
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,500
you're going to be required
to describe the concepts of

53
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,900
cost, value, organization, outcome,

54
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,110
risk, utility and warranty.

55
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,240
On your exam, two questions will come from

56
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,550
this particular learning
objective as well.

57
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,830
Finally, we're going to cover

58
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,540
Learning Objective one point three,

59
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,210
which requires you to be able
to describe the key concepts

60
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,070
of service relationships,
including service offerings,

61
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,720
service relationship management,

62
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,260
service provision, and
service consumption.

63
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,810
On the certification exam,
you can expect to receive

64
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,560
one question from this
particular learning objective.

65
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,050
So let's get started learning
about service management

66
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,363
and it's key concepts.
