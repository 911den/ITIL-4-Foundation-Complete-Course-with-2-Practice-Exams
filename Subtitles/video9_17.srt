1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,360
- Service Design.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,000
This practice is another one

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,480
inside this category that
we're going to discuss

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,060
for your general awareness
but it isn't covered

5
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,300
on the exam.

6
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,080
Now service is the practice
of designing products

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,120
and services that are fit for purpose,

8
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,060
Fit For Use and that it can be delivered

9
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,560
by the organization and its ecosystem.

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,646
Let's break that down a little bit,

11
00:00:19,646 --> 00:00:21,227
cause there's a couple
of key terms in there

12
00:00:21,227 --> 00:00:23,080
that we might recognize.

13
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,110
First, Fit for Purpose.

14
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,710
What does that remind you of?

15
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,420
That's right, utility.

16
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,200
Fit for Purpose is utility.

17
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,425
We want to make sure that our products

18
00:00:31,425 --> 00:00:32,990
has good utility.

19
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,860
They do what we need them to do.

20
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,320
We also have Fit For
Use in this definition.

21
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,560
What's Fit For Use?

22
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,040
Well that's warranty.

23
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,720
We want to make sure
that it meets all of the

24
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,996
standards and requirements
that we were given

25
00:00:42,996 --> 00:00:45,140
as part of our warranty.

26
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,760
And then finally we have this

27
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,380
delivered by the organization
and its ecosystem,

28
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,323
what's that talking about?

29
00:00:50,323 --> 00:00:53,590
It's saying that we have
the capability of doing it.

30
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,960
For example we are a training company.

31
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,640
We have a lot of
capabilities that we can do,

32
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,840
should we be doing video hosting?

33
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,480
Well that's probably not one
of our core capabilities.

34
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,471
So instead, we're not going
to design that service

35
00:01:05,471 --> 00:01:07,600
that we are going to do it in house,

36
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,990
instead we would design it to outsource

37
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,330
that part of our brand.

38
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,480
That way, we can still
make sure we have a service

39
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,800
that is Fit For Use, fit for purpose,

40
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,210
and it can be delivered
effectively by our ecosystem

41
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,980
meaning our partners and suppliers,

42
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,860
as opposed to us the organization ourself.

43
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,013
That's the idea with service design,

44
00:01:25,013 --> 00:01:27,690
you want to think about
your products and services

45
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,190
and how you can best build
them and design them,

46
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,504
so that you're getting the
best warranty and utility,

47
00:01:32,504 --> 00:01:34,133
for your organization.
