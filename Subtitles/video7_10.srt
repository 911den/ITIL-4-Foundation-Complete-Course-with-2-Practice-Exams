1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,860
- Continual improvement
and the guiding principles.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,110
In this lesson I want to briefly discuss

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,260
how we can tie the idea of the
continual improvement model

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,410
back to our guiding principles.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:12,470
You may have thought to yourself

6
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:15,100
while I was covering those
different steps hey, wouldn't

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,670
the
insert-the-name-of-your-guiding-principle
here,

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,430
be very useful during
this step, and guess what?

9
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,790
You would be right.

10
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,290
All of the principles are
applicable and relevant

11
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,890
at nearly every step of
the improvement initiative.

12
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,280
However, some of our
guiding principles are

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,820
especially relevant to certain steps.

14
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,020
So we're going to go through
the seven steps again

15
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,990
really quickly, one more time.

16
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,070
But this time we're
going to link them back

17
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,850
to our useful guiding
principle for each step

18
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,070
and we're going to figure out
which ones are the most useful.

19
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,560
First we have what is the vision.

20
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,970
When we're thinking about the vision

21
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,850
we want to have a focus on value.

22
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,390
We want to think about collaborating

23
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,960
and promoting visibility
so we can share that vision

24
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,570
across the organization.

25
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,990
And we want to think and work holistically

26
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,150
because we want to create a vision

27
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,340
that works for the entire organization,

28
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,510
not just for a single department.

29
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,700
Our second step, where are we now,

30
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,620
that's going to start with where we are.

31
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,990
So going back to the principle
of start where you are

32
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,500
is a great place.

33
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,310
Also, we want to collaborate
and promote visibility.

34
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,780
We want everyone to know
exactly where we are

35
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,700
and how we're performing.

36
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,550
Third, we want to go to
where do we want to be.

37
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,860
This is where we're going to progress

38
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,520
iteratively with feedback.

39
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,080
We're going to start setting out goals

40
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,810
and start some things into motion.

41
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,990
We also want to think
and work holistically

42
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,490
so we can think about
how it's going to affect

43
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,000
the entire organization.

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,990
We also want to think about

45
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,750
keeping it simple and practical.

46
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,760
When I start figuring out

47
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,850
how I'm going to do metrics and measures,

48
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,880
I don't want to have it very complicated.

49
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,970
I want something that's simple, practical,

50
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,410
and easy to measure.

51
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,500
Then I also want to think
about optimizing and automation

52
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,660
because I don't want to have to go

53
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,030
and check all the server spaces manually.

54
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,920
I want to figure out the
capacity metric automated,

55
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,910
and I want to do that
through an optimized method.

56
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:56,980
So these are going to be the four

57
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,820
that are most important to us.

58
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,790
In our fourth step, how do we get there,

59
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,420
we're starting to plan, right?

60
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,800
Well, when we plan we want to plan

61
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,260
to progress iteratively and with feedback.

62
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,670
We also want to make
sure we're collaborating

63
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,610
and promoting visibility of
that plan to everybody else.

64
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,110
We want to think and work
holistically so our plan is

65
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,970
going to affect everyone in
the organization properly.

66
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,720
And we want to keep our
plan simple and practical.

67
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,040
Our fifth step is where we take action.

68
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,670
When we take action
we're focusing on value.

69
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,320
What actions can we do to get us

70
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,300
the most value the quickest?

71
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,890
We also want to progress
iteratively and with feedback,

72
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,810
incorporating that feedback as we go,

73
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,000
and taking positive action
and continually move forward.

74
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,760
Then we want to collaborate
and promote visibility.

75
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,940
We want to make sure everybody knows

76
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,130
what actions we're taking
and why we're doing it.

77
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,180
Next, we're going to
move into the sixth step

78
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,770
which is did we get there.

79
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,760
When we're thinking
about did we get there,

80
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,080
we're again going to
have a focus on value.

81
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,180
We're going to collaborate
and promote the visibility

82
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,320
of the results so people know
yes, we did it, it worked;

83
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,120
or uh-oh, it didn't,
we need to try harder.

84
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,170
And we want to think and work holistically

85
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,850
again across the entire organization.

86
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,350
That brings us to our
seventh and final step.

87
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,140
How do we keep the momentum going?

88
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,170
Well, we're going to focus on value.

89
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,340
We're going to collaborate
and promote visibility,

90
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,310
sharing the message with everybody else.

91
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,810
We're going to think and work holistically

92
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,520
across the organization.

93
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,690
And now that we've got
something that's working,

94
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,270
we want to optimize it,
and once we optimize it

95
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,480
we want to automate it.

96
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,020
So optimize and automate would be

97
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,720
our last guiding principle.

98
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,710
So as you can see, by using
the continual improvement

99
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,430
along with the guiding principles,

100
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,240
you can create a solid framework

101
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,520
for successful service management.

102
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,830
These concept models
work exceptionally well

103
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,100
with Agile methodologies,
especially with that

104
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,890
progressive iterative feedback,

105
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,040
and we also can use it for
DevOps or development operations

106
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,820
and Lean frameworks as well.

107
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,700
It really does work well
and it is an excellent tool

108
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,730
to put in your toolbox as you move forward

109
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,793
into the real world.
