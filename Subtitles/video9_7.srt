1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:04,110
- Service request management,
this is the last practice

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,890
that we're going to discuss in depth.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,180
The purpose of the service
request management practice

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,810
is to support the agreed
quality of a service

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,790
by handling all agreed
user-initiated service requests

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:16,360
in an effective and user-friendly manner.

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,350
Now, service requests are
predefined and pre-agreed

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,510
and they can usually be
formalized with clear,

9
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,010
standard procedures.

10
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,890
That makes things really easy.

11
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,120
For example, you might have one that says,

12
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,170
let's create a new email distribution.

13
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,550
There's a standard process for it

14
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,600
and a standard request method to do it,

15
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,510
or maybe you need a headphone set

16
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,690
to be attached to your computer at work.

17
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,900
This might be, again, a service request.

18
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,680
Maybe you want to go
from a 15-inch monitor

19
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,130
to a 21-inch monitor,
that might be, again,

20
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,800
a standard service request.

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,810
There's basically three pieces that go

22
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,510
with the standard service request.

23
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,050
You have initiation,
approval, and fulfillment.

24
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,890
Now, service requests are
normally part of service delivery

25
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,740
and they're not used for failure

26
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,410
or degradation of a service.

27
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,420
That's used in incident management.

28
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,170
Instead, service requests
are asking for things

29
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,010
that are normal, things that we need.

30
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,760
I need more share drive space.

31
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,410
I need a bigger email account.

32
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,600
I need another email address,
I need my account unlocked.

33
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,250
Those are all things that
would be service requests.

34
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,600
A service request is simply
a request from a user

35
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,550
or a user's authorized representative

36
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,180
that initiates a service
action that has been agreed

37
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,670
as a normal part of service delivery.

38
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,340
The fulfillment of that service request

39
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,880
may include changes to
services or their components

40
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,590
and they usually are going to
be considered a standard change

41
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,170
because they're low-risk
and well understood.

42
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,170
Some examples of these would be a request

43
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,640
for a service delivery action,

44
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,890
like get a new computer for
the new employee we just hired.

45
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,720
It might be a request for information.

46
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,860
It might be a request for
provision of a resource

47
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,740
or a service, give me 10
gigabytes of storage space

48
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,310
instead of five gigabytes.

49
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,730
It might be a request to
get access to a resource

50
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,720
or a service, hey, I need access

51
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,230
to the accounting share drive now,

52
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,150
because I just got transferred over there.

53
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,780
That might be a good example, right?

54
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,190
And it can also have feedback,
compliments, and complaints.

55
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,090
All of those might go through
the service request process.

56
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,640
Service requests and their fulfillment

57
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,680
should always be
standardized and automated

58
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,380
to the greatest degree possible.

59
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,400
Again, these are low risk things.

60
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,220
You want to try to do
them as much as possible

61
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,700
through a self-help system,

62
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,900
so you're not tying up good people,

63
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,970
using up full-time equivalent
man hours or person hours

64
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,700
on these standard service requests.

65
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,630
Instead, we want to reserve
those man hours or person hours

66
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,790
or full-time equivalents
for those incidents

67
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,470
that we need to work through.

68
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,530
There's a lot of
opportunities for improvement

69
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,820
inside of the service request process.

70
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,360
You should always be identifying them

71
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,280
and then implement them to
provide faster fulfillment times

72
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,770
and take advantage of
automation whenever possible.

73
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,660
This allows you to make sure your policies

74
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,560
are established properly, and
if you have proper policies,

75
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,250
this is going to make
sure your service requests

76
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,850
can be fulfilled with limited

77
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,900
or even no additional approvals,

78
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,890
so that fulfillment can be streamlined,

79
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,560
optimized, and process automated.

80
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,260
This is a great way of doing things.

81
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,530
It minimizes the overhead and ensures

82
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,640
the customer gets what they
need as quickly as possible.

83
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,490
Now, the expectations from users

84
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:07,060
regarding fulfillment times
should be clearly set,

85
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,000
and delivered based on
what the organization

86
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,680
can realistically deliver.

87
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,500
For example, if you buy
a voucher from my site,

88
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,030
I tell you that you can
get it in under 10 minutes

89
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,160
if it's in stock.

90
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,450
If it's not in stock,

91
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,210
you're going to have to
wait one to two days,

92
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,840
because we have to refill our stock,

93
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,380
and manually fulfill it.

94
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,950
So that's the way we tell you,

95
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,670
as an expectation to our users,

96
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,250
you know what you're getting into.

97
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,690
If I didn't tell you that, you'd order it

98
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,820
and think it was going to
be there in five seconds,

99
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,820
and if it wasn't, you'd get upset, right?

100
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,340
That's the idea here with
service request fulfillment.

101
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,840
You want to make sure people understand

102
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,740
how that fulfillment's going to operate.

103
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,580
Now, sometimes your service requests

104
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,770
are actually going to be miscategorized.

105
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,580
People submit it as a service request,

106
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,710
but it really is a change or an incident.

107
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,120
In this case, you want to make sure

108
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,700
your policies and your
workflows are set up properly

109
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,780
so they can redirect
those service requests

110
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,680
over to the incident management process

111
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,660
or to the change management
process, as appropriate.

112
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,400
Also, some of your service requests

113
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,420
are going to require
additional authorization,

114
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,180
and that might be based on your financial

115
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,540
information security or other policies.

116
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,510
Going back to the example
of a bigger monitor,

117
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,730
you want to go from a 15-inch
monitor to a 27-inch monitor.

118
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,410
There may be a cost associated with that,

119
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,270
so you can't get that
approval on your own.

120
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,210
Instead, you put it in
as a service request

121
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:19,090
and that goes to your
boss, who then approves

122
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,440
the financial part of
it, or maybe I wanted

123
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,700
to get access to the
accounting shared drive.

124
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,900
Well, that's an information
security concern,

125
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,950
so somebody from accounting

126
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,190
is going to have to approve that concern.

127
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,030
Service request management
is going to depend

128
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,200
on well-defined processes and procedures

129
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,570
as I've been talking about.

130
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,010
The more you can do this,
the better you can track

131
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,100
and automate all of these requests,

132
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,180
minimizing the manpower involved,

133
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,530
and your service request
can have simple workflows

134
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,260
or very complex workflows.

135
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,490
It really depends on
how you need to do it,

136
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,650
based on your organization, what changes,

137
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,840
and what approvals need
to be placed in there.

138
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,160
You want to make sure all the steps

139
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,820
to fulfill these requests
are well-known and proven.

140
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,870
You've tested it, you made sure it worked,

141
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,670
you optimized it, and
then you automated it.

142
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,400
Your service provider can always
agree to fulfillment times,

143
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,450
and provide clear status to their users.

144
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,940
You want to make sure you're
always using that engage arm

145
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,220
so that you're telling
your users what to expect.

146
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,930
If you give them a good
expectation of when it should be,

147
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,020
that's going to help clear
up a lot of the confusion

148
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,000
and a lot of the angst that
your customers may have.

149
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,800
When you're thinking about
your service requests,

150
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,480
remember, a lot of these can be done

151
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,370
through a self-service experience.

152
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,090
Things like password resets,

153
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,900
asking for more share drive space,

154
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,140
a lot of these can be completely
fulfilled with automation,

155
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,840
so when you're doing
service request management,

156
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,000
think about automation.

157
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,900
I think you've heard me say
that a lot in this lesson,

158
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,800
but it's really important inside this.

159
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,250
Also, I want you to leverage
your existing workflow models

160
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,370
whenever possible,

161
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,740
so you don't have to start
building things from scratch.

162
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,700
Any time you have something,

163
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,860
even if it's the manual
fulfillment process,

164
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,010
start looking at it,
how can you optimize it,

165
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,710
and then how can you automate it?

166
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,440
So, I know we just covered a lot

167
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,910
in service request management,

168
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,370
but we're going to talk about it now

169
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,713
from the value chain perspective.

170
00:05:55,713 --> 00:05:57,610
When we think about it from improve,

171
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,060
how is this going to relate?

172
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,220
Well, in this case,
service request management

173
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,520
can provide us a channel
for improvement initiatives.

174
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,900
We can get complaints and
comments from our users

175
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,140
and then we can contribute that

176
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,700
into the improvement process,

177
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,320
so that we can find those trends

178
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,970
and think of how we can make
things better in the future.

179
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,000
When we think about it from
the engage perspective,

180
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,800
we want to make sure that
service request management

181
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,630
is including regular communications

182
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,860
to tell the users what they can expect.

183
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,100
What are the requirements,
what are the expectations,

184
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,850
and what is the status?

185
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,240
When we think about this from the design

186
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,820
and transition perspective,
we have these standard changes

187
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,340
to services that we're requesting,

188
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,210
and we're initiating
them and fulfilling them

189
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,690
as service requests.

190
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,410
Also, in obtain and build,
when I'm requesting something,

191
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,940
it has to be fulfilled, and
it's going to be fulfilled,

192
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,670
that means we might have to
go buy something, obtain,

193
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,230
or build it, under the
build, and this is the way

194
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,880
we're going to do things as
a tie-in to that service.

195
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,440
And then finally, when we talk
about deliver and support,

196
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,520
service request management
makes a significant contribution

197
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,070
to our normal service delivery,

198
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,670
because this activity is
going to tell our users

199
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,200
all the things we can do for them,

200
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,130
and allow those things to be requested.

201
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,370
You might want a bigger monitor.

202
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,760
You might want more share drive space.

203
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,630
You might need a new user account.

204
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,560
All of these things are
things that we can do

205
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,490
and ensure the users get what
they need to be productive,

206
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,940
and it makes sure that
we fulfill those needs.

207
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,080
That's what service request
management is all about,

208
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,360
making sure the users are
getting what they need,

209
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,713
so that they can operate
at peak efficiency.
