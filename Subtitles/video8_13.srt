1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,940
- The next practice we're going
to discuss is risk management,

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,260
and again this is just for
your general awareness,

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:07,900
but it one we've talked about earlier

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,000
on in our course, because we did talk

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,440
about those four things
you can do with risk.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,840
When we talk about risk management,

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,760
this practice is focused on ensuring

8
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,770
that an organization understands

9
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,080
and handles its risk effectively.

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,460
Now, when we look at risk,
there are four things

11
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,450
you can do with it.

12
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:26,150
You can avoid risk, you can mitigate risk,

13
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,930
you can transfer risk,
or you can accept risk.

14
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,720
When you avoid risk, you're
going to change the situation

15
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,090
so that risk doesn't exist anymore.

16
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,130
I like to use the example
of if your company

17
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,360
has a computer that's running Windows XP,

18
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,190
that's a highly risky event.

19
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,340
Well, you can avoid that risk completely

20
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,330
by turning off that computer,
upgrading it to Windows 10,

21
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,220
and now you have that
risk completely avoided,

22
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,990
because you're no longer having the risk

23
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,150
of having this old, outdated system.

24
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,870
Now, mitigation on the other hand,

25
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,820
is where we're going to
put some things in place

26
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,760
to help lower the amount of risk.

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,070
For example, if I wanted to drive

28
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,740
my car from here to the store,

29
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,830
I'm not going to drive
it 60 miles an hour.

30
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,110
I decided I'm going to
drive it 30 miles an hour.

31
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,250
That lowers my risk

32
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,820
because it gives me more
time to react to issues.

33
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,680
That's a risk mitigation.

34
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,320
When I talk about risk transference,

35
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,210
that's when I'm going to transfer
the risk to somebody else.

36
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,730
In the example of my car,

37
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,760
I have an insurance policy on my car.

38
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,330
If I get into an accident,

39
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,970
I'm not the one who assumes that risk.

40
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,200
The insurance company is.

41
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,760
They're going to pay for the damages,

42
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,210
because I paid them a
premium and that transferred

43
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,630
the risk from me to them
for that financial issue.

44
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,820
And finally, we have risk acceptance.

45
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,680
If you have a risk that's small enough,

46
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,000
you might just decided
you're going to accept it.

47
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,850
For example, there are risk
every day that you deal with,

48
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,700
and you just simply accept them.

49
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,210
When you get in the car to drive to work,

50
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,560
there's a risk you could
get into an accident.

51
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,780
Yes, you've transferred
the financial risk,

52
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,060
but if you get into an accident

53
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,710
you're still going to get hurt, right?

54
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,300
Well, you figured that
that risk is small enough

55
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,830
that you have accepted that risk,

56
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,600
whether willing or unwillingly,

57
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,650
so that you can drive your car to work.

58
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,470
That's the idea when you
deal with risk management.

59
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,310
It's identifying all the
risks that are going to exist

60
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,810
for our product and services,

61
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,750
as well as our projects
as we're deploying them.

62
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,580
And then we try to mitigate them,

63
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,750
transfer them, avoid them, or accept them,

64
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,053
and that way we know
what we're dealing with.
