1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,440
- Design and transition.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,350
This is the next value chain activity

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,840
we're going to talk about.

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,130
The purpose of the design

5
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,120
and transition value chain activity

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,320
is to insure that the
products and services

7
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,430
are continually meeting the stakeholder

8
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:17,800
expectations for quality,
cost and time to market.

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,360
This is where we're going to make sure

10
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,370
that we're figuring out

11
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,260
how this product is
actually going to be built.

12
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,410
This is where we come up
with all the designs for it

13
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,340
and then plan how we're going to move it

14
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,810
from an idea to actually being built

15
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,240
and put out into the marketplace.

16
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,880
There's lots of different inputs

17
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,210
into the design and transition phase.

18
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,200
When we start talking about
design and transition,

19
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,700
we have to take in things
like portfolio decisions

20
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,600
that come out of the planning area.

21
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,630
We also want to make sure we
understand the architectures

22
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,300
and the policies that plans has created.

23
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,680
We're going to take things from
the engagement area as well,

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,670
things like product and
service requirements

25
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,970
that engage has gotten from
the customers and the consumers

26
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,330
and other areas.

27
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,460
We also want to make sure that
we're taking in to account

28
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,740
the improvement initiatives

29
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,610
and the plans that come
out of the improve process.

30
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:03,443
We're also going to be looking

31
00:01:03,443 --> 00:01:05,210
at all those improvement status reports

32
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,290
that came from improve.

33
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,120
So, we can figure out how do we design

34
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,190
things better next time.

35
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,220
We're also going to take a look

36
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,440
at all of our service
performance information

37
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,660
that comes out of our deliver

38
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,170
and support, and improve processes.

39
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,510
Are we meeting the service
targets that have been set?

40
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,850
Have we transitioned
something successfully?

41
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,330
All of these things are
things we need to consider

42
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,980
as we're designing and
transitioning our services

43
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,770
to take them from an
idea, and from a plan,

44
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,500
all the way out into a real usable thing

45
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,600
that is going to be delivered
to a consumer to use.

46
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,680
All of this happens inside

47
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,220
of this design and transition area.

48
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,770
Now, as we start looking at this,

49
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,420
we're also going to take in some things

50
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,620
that come from the
obtain and build process.

51
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,470
Things like what service
components are available.

52
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,670
Obtain and build already

53
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,780
has a lot of things that have been built.

54
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,970
Maybe as we're designing a new service,

55
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,640
we can reuse some of the things

56
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,260
that already exist and use
them in our new service.

57
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,760
And finally, we have to consider

58
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,490
the knowledge and information.

59
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,660
Now, knowledge and information

60
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,630
is going to come from
two different places.

61
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,800
First we have knowledge

62
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,450
and information about third party

63
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,540
service components from engage.

64
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,900
This is where we're
going to be considering

65
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,800
just like we did for obtain and build,

66
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,540
what things are available to use.

67
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,230
But now we're doing it
from a third party partner,

68
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,920
or a supplier perspective.

69
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,290
If we know that our supplier
has this type of capability

70
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,530
then we can help better design
and transition something

71
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,630
that works around that capability.

72
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,350
The other part of
knowledge and information

73
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,970
is the knowledge and information about

74
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,290
new and changed products and services.

75
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,250
This is what we're going to
get from our obtain and build.

76
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,280
As we have built and obtained things,

77
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,430
we're going to get the
product specifications,

78
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,610
the known errors and other information.

79
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,760
And all of that can serve as an input

80
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,500
into this design and transition activity.

81
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,920
Now, as far as outputs from this activity,

82
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,380
we're going to be
looking at getting things

83
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,570
like the requirement
and the specifications.

84
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,370
And passing those over
to the obtain and build.

85
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,680
So, as I've designed
this brand new service

86
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,000
that's going to do voucher
fulfillment for my students.

87
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,480
I need to come up with
what the requirements

88
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,250
and specifications are,
and pass that to the people

89
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,470
who are actually going to buy the servers

90
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,650
and buy the integrations, and
buy the automation software

91
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,260
that's going to allow that to occur,

92
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,370
inside of obtain and build.

93
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,690
Also, if we need to contract something,

94
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,030
we're going to go and
pass that over to engage.

95
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,730
We need to give them the contract

96
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,620
and the agreement
requirements that we need

97
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,080
for service level agreements,

98
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,750
service management agreements
and different contracts

99
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,580
for supplies and partners,
and send that through engage

100
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,600
out to those external entities.

101
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,130
Another output is any new and
changed products and services

102
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,940
that we're going to get from
the design and transition,

103
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,180
and we're going to pass
those and transition those

104
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,600
over to deliver and support.

105
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,760
Another thing we start talking about,

106
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,110
knowledge and information.

107
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,380
We get knowledge and information,

108
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,520
about new and changed
products or services.

109
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,420
We're going to pass that not
just to obtain and build,

110
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,520
but to all of the different parts

111
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,080
of the value chain activities.

112
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,900
Because plans need to know about it.

113
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,490
So, they can figure out what version two,

114
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,150
and three, and four is going to look like.

115
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,190
We need to pass that over to
design and transition ourself

116
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,760
as we design the next version.

117
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,030
We need to pass that
over to obtain and build

118
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,810
so they can build the
things as you design them.

119
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,660
You need to pass that over
to deliver and support,

120
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,340
so they know how to
support it when it breaks.

121
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,720
All the value chain activities

122
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,250
need that knowledge and information

123
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,410
about new or changed products.

124
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,860
And finally, we want to make sure

125
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,910
we're getting performance
information and improvement

126
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,670
opportunities out of the
design and transition

127
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,680
and back over to improve.

128
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,300
As we go through and we
design and build something,

129
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,000
we're going to find out that hey,

130
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,270
when we try to design X system,

131
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,830
we had problems one, two, and three.

132
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,530
We'll pass that over to improve

133
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,830
so, they can come up with ways

134
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,400
for us to improve our processes

135
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,100
and make it more efficient.

136
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,160
So, when we look at this
at the end of the day.

137
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,460
When we start talking
about design and transition

138
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,907
as an activity, think about
taking some idea from plans,

139
00:04:53,907 --> 00:04:57,620
making it into what will be
built in obtain and build.

140
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,130
That's kind of the main focus.

141
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,570
But there's all these
other inputs and outputs

142
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,990
for this activity,
because those are things

143
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,080
that are going to happen
in a non-sequential manner

144
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,290
because things are are
happening all the times

145
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,393
in rapid development when
we're dealing with IT services.
