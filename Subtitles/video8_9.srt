1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,220
- Measurement and reporting.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,000
Measurement and reporting is
another one of those practices

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,500
that's not covered by the ITIL 4 Exam.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,540
But it's a good one to
know because there are

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,200
pieces of this that we
have discussed already.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,080
Now, measurement and
reporting is the practice

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,850
of supporting good decision making

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,760
and continual improvement by decreasing

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,400
levels of uncertainty.

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,260
We do this by measuring things.

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,730
If you remember back in our
continual improvement model,

12
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,380
we talked about measuring
and creating a baseline.

13
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,460
And then, after we took
action, we went back

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,060
and measured again to
see how things changed.

15
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,260
That's what measuring and
reporting is all about.

16
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,160
When discussing measurement and reporting,

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,990
two key terms come up a lot.

18
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,660
It's KPIs, or Key Performance Indicators,

19
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,130
and CSFs, or Critical Success Factors.

20
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,900
We've already discussed both of these back

21
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,390
when we talked about the model
inside continual improvement.

22
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,710
Now, when you talk about
measurement and reporting,

23
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,190
remember what I said very
early on in this course.

24
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,560
It's very easy to measure outputs,

25
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,020
but it's difficult to measure outcomes.

26
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,280
One of the difficulties of this practice

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,110
is being able to figure out what things

28
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,890
you really should be measuring
and are you measuring

29
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,000
the right things.

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,450
Because we want to make
sure we're measuring

31
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,460
the outcome and not just the outputs.

32
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,830
Again, this is an entire field with people

33
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,100
who are dedicated to it.

34
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,330
You're going to get people
from business analysis

35
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,940
that are going to be working in this field

36
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,830
that really help you drive those numbers

37
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,920
and figure out what are those key metrics

38
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,233
that your business needs.
