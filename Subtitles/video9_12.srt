1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,960
- Availability management.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,700
This is one that you don't
have to recall for the exam.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,080
Instead, this begins the ones
that we're going to talk about

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,930
for your general awareness.

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,770
What is availability management?

6
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,600
Well, it's a practice to
ensure services are delivered

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,810
at agreed-upon levels of availability

8
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,400
to meet the needs of customers and users.

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,050
When we talk about availability,

10
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,370
we're talking about the
ability of an IT service

11
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,960
or other configuration item

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,150
to perform its agreed-upon
function when it's required.

13
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,070
For example, if you want to
go to my website right now,

14
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,860
you want to make when you
type in diontraining.com,

15
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,270
the website comes up
and you can read things.

16
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,150
That means it's available.

17
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,950
We aim to have 99.999% availability,

18
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,980
which means that our
website is up at least

19
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,570
the entire year minus five minutes.

20
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,210
That's a pretty big ask, right?

21
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,180
To do that, we use load balancers,

22
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,960
we use multiple redundant servers,

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,830
and all sorts of cloud infrastructure

24
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,120
to make sure our server is up and running

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,880
any time you're trying to get to it.

26
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,810
That's what we're trying
to do with availability,

27
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,220
and availability management

28
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,023
is simply the practice to
ensure that that happens.
