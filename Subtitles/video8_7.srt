1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,740
- Architecture Management.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,290
This is another one that you don't need

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,290
to know for the foundation level exam,

4
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:07,170
but we're going to cover it

5
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,440
to give you a good general
understanding of it.

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,260
The practice of architecture management

7
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,010
is one that's focused on
providing an understanding of

8
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,780
all of the different elements
that make up an organization

9
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,910
and how those elements interrelate,

10
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,980
enabling the organization to
effectively achieve its current

11
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,720
and future objectives.

12
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,200
Now, this provides your
organization with the principles,

13
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,860
the standards, and the tools

14
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,630
that will enable us to
manage complex changes

15
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,420
in a much more structured and agile way.

16
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,430
There are five different
types of architectures

17
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,710
that you should consider
inside your business.

18
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,280
These are business architecture,

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,460
service architecture,
information systems architecture,

20
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,890
technology architecture, and
environmental architecture.

21
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,010
Business architecture
allows an organization to

22
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,320
look at its capabilities

23
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,710
to determine how they align
with the different activities

24
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,460
that are required for that business

25
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,260
to co-create value for its customers.

26
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,850
Now, service architecture is
going to give the organization

27
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,040
a view of its services

28
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,550
and their interactions to
better understand how they are

29
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,030
all going to interrelate and tie together.

30
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,550
This usually results in a
service model being created

31
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,970
and this can act as a template

32
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,110
or a blueprint for multiple services

33
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,710
across the organization.

34
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,090
When we look at information
systems architecture,

35
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,580
we're focused on the logical

36
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,060
and physical data assets
of the organization,

37
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,240
and how they are managed

38
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,230
and shared to benefit our overall goals.

39
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,980
The technology architecture
is going to find the software

40
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,540
and the hardware infrastructure

41
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,820
that's needed to support
the portfolio of services

42
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,080
and the products the organization offers.

43
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,920
For example, to answer the question

44
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,090
of whether we should use a
self-hosted configuration

45
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,950
for our web servers or if we should rely

46
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,530
on a cloud-based architecture,

47
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,680
would fall under this technology
architecture umbrella.

48
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,150
And finally, environmental architecture.

49
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,010
This is used to describe the
external factors that affect

50
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,040
and impact our organization.

51
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,640
If you remember our
discussion of PESTLE early on,

52
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,620
this model would fall under
the environmental architecture,

53
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,590
things like political,
environmental, social, technological.

54
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,690
You get the idea.

55
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,130
All of those things are
external to our organization,

56
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,827
so they are considered environmental.

57
00:02:05,827 --> 00:02:07,983
(upbeat chiming)
