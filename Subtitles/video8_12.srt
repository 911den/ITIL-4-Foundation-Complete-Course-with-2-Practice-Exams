1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,970
- Our next practice is project management.

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:05,640
Now unlike portfolio management,

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,220
where we're trying to figure out what are

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,440
the different projects
and products and services

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,690
that we should create,

6
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,410
project management is
focused on a single product

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,090
or service or project that
we're trying to get through.

8
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,000
Project management is
the practice of ensuring

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,100
that all of our organization's projects

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,950
are delivered successfully.

11
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,540
So, when I decided to make this course,

12
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,910
this course became a project.

13
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,400
We then went through our
PRINCE2 methodologies,

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,680
and we built the entire course based on

15
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,670
that project management life cycle.

16
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,950
As we moved it from our idea,
through the different phases,

17
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,410
to finally getting it completed,

18
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,650
and getting it out to you,

19
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,710
that took the project from idea

20
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,220
all the way through to delivery.

21
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,590
And if we do that properly,

22
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,830
and we can do it successfully,

23
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,480
if we're using a good
project management process.

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,740
Now why is project
management so important?

25
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,660
Well, let's say you need to install

26
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,960
a brand new network for your organization.

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,630
It's going to be hundreds of computers,

28
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,210
dozens of servers, lots of
racks of network equipment

29
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,040
and all of that kind of stuff.

30
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,060
Well, if you were doing
it all by yourself,

31
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,930
you might not need project management.

32
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,470
But you're probably going
to have a team of five or 10

33
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,290
or 50 people working for you.

34
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,270
And if you have a large
team, everyone needs to know

35
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,660
what their role is and
what pieces need to be done

36
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,030
and when those pieces need to be done,

37
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,780
at which piece of time.

38
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,290
Do I need to get the servers in first

39
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:20,680
or the racks in first?

40
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,240
Do I need to get the work stations online

41
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,930
before or after the servers?

42
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,010
All of those things are things
that are going to be handled

43
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,440
within project management.

44
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,900
They're going to figure out the timing,

45
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,220
the sequencing and making sure we can get

46
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,110
from the idea and the plan

47
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,610
to the final execution, successfully.

48
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,520
Project management is a huge field

49
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,140
and if you're interested
in project management,

50
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,410
I recommend looking into
the PRINCE2 courses,

51
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,310
which are focused on project management

52
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,900
or doing something like PMP,

53
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,720
which is Project Management Professional.

54
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,370
Depending on where you live in the world,

55
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:51,140
one of those two certifications
is going to be more popular.

56
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,780
Here in the United States,

57
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,840
PMP tends to be a little bit more popular.

58
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,610
If you're in Europe or Asia,

59
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,310
PRINCE2 seems to be more popular.

60
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,800
So if you want to get
into project management,

61
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,140
those would be my recommendation,

62
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,590
looking at those two courses.
