1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:04,450
- Optimize and automate,
this is our 7th and final

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,240
guiding principal and we
have this one as our 7th one,

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,980
because it is really one of
the ones you want to do last,

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,560
cuz you're going to
implement a lot of the other

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,030
guiding principals and
then optimize and automate.

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,010
But, what is optimize mean?

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,340
Well, it means to make
something as effective

8
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,830
and useful as it makes sense to do.

9
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,400
Before an activity can
be effectively automated,

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,580
you first want to make
sure you're optimizing it

11
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,710
to whatever degree is
possible and reasonable.

12
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,660
By doing this, you're going
to make sure that you're

13
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,200
not just doing things
automatically and quicker,

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,970
but you're doing them the
best way and then you can

15
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,970
make them automated and quicker.

16
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,270
And so to do this we really
want to understand and

17
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,010
agree to the context
before the optimization,

18
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,970
by figuring out what that process is,

19
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,860
by keeping it simple
using our 6th principle.

20
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,560
We then can go through and
assess the current state

21
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,770
to understand where it can be improved.

22
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,880
That sounds familiar, that
was one of our earlier

23
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,320
guiding principles right,
starting where you are.

24
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,510
And then we want to focus
on simplification, again,

25
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,380
keeping it simple, and get
a value that's involved to

26
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,000
agree to our future state.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,700
That might be something
like focusing on value

28
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,250
then we want to insure
that we optimize it for the

29
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,090
appropriate level of stakeholder
engagement and commitment.

30
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,930
So that goes back to
collaborating with other people.

31
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,160
Then once we do that, we're
going to execute all of those

32
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,801
improvements in an iterative
way, progressing iteratively,

33
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:26,320
using metrics and other
feedback to check our progress

34
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,630
and stay on track to adjust as needed.

35
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,810
And once all of that's done,
we're going to continually

36
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,180
monitor it to identify any opportunities

37
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,210
to improve our work methods.

38
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,460
You can see that by optimizing
things, we really are pulling

39
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,460
in areas from all of the
other guiding principles.

40
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,100
Now, once we've optimized it
and we have the best process

41
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,270
in the least amount of steps
that's ready to be automated,

42
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,300
we're going to move into automation.

43
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,790
Now, automation is the use of
technology to perform a step

44
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,820
or series of steps
correctly and consistently

45
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,600
with limited or no human intervention.

46
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,040
By automating, we can automate
frequent and repetitive tasks

47
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,100
to help our organizations
scale up and free up those

48
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,580
human resources to be used for
more complex decision making.

49
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,380
In the last lesson I was talking about the

50
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,710
incident management desk.

51
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,310
You may automate the
first three categories

52
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,140
or something like password resets.

53
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,450
That frees up people to be
able to do more of the harder

54
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,850
complex decision making and
problems solving techniques.

55
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,630
In my company we did this
exact same thing with our

56
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,250
voucher for filming system.

57
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,520
At first, it was a manual method.

58
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,860
You would order a voucher,
I would then order it from

59
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,580
the company, I would turn
around take that, package it up

60
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,710
in an email and send it back to you.

61
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,340
Over time, we started getting
a lot of people who were

62
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,090
buying vouchers, and so it
was eating up a lot of my time

63
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,270
as a person, and then it
started eating up a lot of

64
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,340
my assistants time when
she started doing it.

65
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,650
And so what we ended up doing was

66
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,810
we ended up automating that system.

67
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,440
Now when you go to our
website and you buy a voucher,

68
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,100
there is no human involvement.

69
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,390
Its going to go through, pull
the next available voucher

70
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,480
for our inventory, put it in an email,

71
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,760
give you the directions,
email it back to you,

72
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,240
and all of that happens in a
matter of seconds or minutes.

73
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,150
The simplest form of automation
is always going to involve

74
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,098
standardizing and streamlining
all of these manual tasks

75
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:13,950
to allow decisions to
be made automatically.

76
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,380
In our case, that's exactly what happened.

77
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,810
The all the decision it
needs to do is figure out did

78
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,070
you order an idle 4
voucher, an idle 3 voucher,

79
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,390
a prince 2 voucher.

80
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,910
Based on that it pulls the
right one and sends it back

81
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,030
to you, its all automated.

82
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,140
That's the beauty of it, because
now I was able to free up

83
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,740
those powers of human labor to go do other

84
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,330
more important things like
make study guides for you,

85
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,650
or make new slides, or new
videos, or do video editing,

86
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,350
or answer student questions.

87
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,820
All of that is being able to be done,

88
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,175
because we automated simple process.

89
00:03:45,175 --> 00:03:47,490
So when you think about this,

90
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,260
how are you going to apply this principle.

91
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,120
Well first you're going
to simplify and optimize

92
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,820
before you ever automate.

93
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,200
You don't want to take
something that has 1000 steps

94
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,640
and automate it, because
now its just doing that

95
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,550
bad process faster.

96
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,760
That's still costing you time,

97
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,230
and its still costing you money.

98
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,350
Instead, we want to take that process,

99
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:08,770
get it down to the simplest
steps, and then automate it.

100
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,590
Because that's going to
save you the most time

101
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,930
and the most money.

102
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,260
Next, I also want you to look for

103
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,240
anything that's done
manually and repetitively.

104
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,230
If you for instance get an email every day

105
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,970
for an email newsletter and
you always have to take it

106
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,820
and drag it to your trash can.

107
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,520
That takes up maybe 2 or
3 seconds of your time,

108
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,503
but you could apply an
automated filter that

109
00:04:27,503 --> 00:04:28,960
any time that email comes in

110
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,980
it automatically moves
it to your trash can

111
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,770
or you can go and unsubscribe right.

112
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,380
But you get the idea,
anything that you see

113
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,230
yourself doing day in and day out,

114
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,820
there's probably a computer
program that can be done to

115
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,070
optimize it and automate it
so you don't have to do it.

116
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,480
Second, I want you to
always define your metrics.

117
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,380
What does good look like?

118
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,660
If were talking about my
voucher for filming system,

119
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,070
our metric is that you're going
to get your voucher within

120
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,600
5 minutes of ordering, and
that's pretty generous,

121
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,000
usually it takes about 60 seconds.

122
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,300
Again, define your metrics
so you can then look

123
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,650
at your systems and see
if they've been optimized

124
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,690
and automated properly to
meet the metrics you have.

125
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,740
Also, you want to make
sure you're using the other

126
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,920
guiding principles when
you apply this one.

127
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,490
As I said, we're going to use a
lot of these other principles.

128
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,400
We're going to think
and work holistically,

129
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,320
cuz we look at the whole
system as a whole we

130
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,080
can figure out where the
optimizations can best be taken.

131
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,050
We're also going to look
at starting where you are,

132
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,490
because we need to know where we are

133
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,830
to figure out how we can
get to the next level.

134
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,870
We also want to keep it
simple and practical,

135
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,950
because we want to eliminate
steps that aren't needed

136
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,270
or aren't practical.

137
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:31,240
Then, we want to build on that
by progressing iteratively

138
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,450
and with feedback, and
finally we always have a focus

139
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,730
on value, we always want to
make sure that what we're

140
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,550
doing is for a reason.

141
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,510
Were doing this process to give
more value to our consumers,

142
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,550
or to our organization or to both.

143
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,700
So that was our 7 guiding
principals, and they all get

144
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,650
kind of get summed up here at the end with

145
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,910
Optimize and Automate,
because we really do

146
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,970
dig into all those principles as

147
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,953
we work through optimizing
and automating our systems.
