00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,790
- Service Validation and Testing.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,390
This is our final
practice in this section.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,000
Now again, this is not one
you need to know for the exam

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
but just for your general awareness.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,960
Service validation and testing
is the practice of ensuring

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,320
that new or changed products

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,060
and services meet the
defined requirements.

8
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,470
Now, what does that mean?

9
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,800
Well, let's say I was going
to build a new website.

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,000
Before I put it out
there for public release,

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,070
I would want to make sure we went

12
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,970
through some sort of service validation

13
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,190
to make sure everything's
working properly,

14
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,100
and we'd go through some beta testing

15
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,700
to ensure we tested it in-house,

16
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,420
we brought in some external testers,

17
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,150
and it was doing everything
the way that we need it to.

18
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,610
That's the idea in service
validation and testing.

19
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,151
Before you go and transition
this into the live environment,

20
00:00:41,151 --> 00:00:44,070
you want to make sure everything
is operating properly,

21
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,520
and then, once you've transferred over

22
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,757
to the live environment,
you go back and validate it

23
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:52,190
to make sure it's still operating
the way you designed it.

24
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,320
That's all service validation

25
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,830
and testing really comes down to.

26
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,510
It's making sure you're testing things

27
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,380
before you release them
and after you release them

28
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,230
to make sure they're operating
the way you designed them.
