00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,750
- Supplier Management.

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,410
The supplier management practice
is the last one you have

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,200
to remember from the
general management section.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,290
As we talk about this,

5
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:10,640
you need to remember the definition

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,320
of the purpose of supplier management.

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,720
The purpose of supplier
management is to ensure

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,960
the organization's suppliers
and their performance

9
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,220
are managed appropriately to support the

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,720
provisioning of seamless,
quality products,

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,820
services, and components.

12
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,550
Really what this means is
that we are going to make sure

13
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,910
that we have a good
relationship with our suppliers,

14
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,690
and that way, we can
ensure that we're creating

15
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,890
these close, collaborative relationships

16
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,610
with those key suppliers
to uncover and realize

17
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,420
new value and reduce our risk of failure.

18
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,540
If I rely heavily on a certain person

19
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,700
to provide us a service or a supply,

20
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,600
we want to make sure we
have a good relationship

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,300
so we know when things
might not be working right.

22
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,620
If we have that, they'll be
able to come and tell us,

23
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,730
'Hey, you know what? We know we
promised that we were going to

24
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,940
have this delivered to you
by Friday, but we're running

25
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,540
behind and it's now going
to be until Monday.'

26
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,592
I'd rather them tell me that
now, so I can plan for that,

27
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:03,600
than Friday comes along, and
the thing doesn't arrive.

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,470
This is the idea with supplier management.

29
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,930
By having good relationships,
we can ensure we get

30
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,320
better products, more quality products,

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,510
and better service and supplies.

32
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,550
So again, remember, the purpose
of the supplier management

33
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,119
practice is to ensure the
organization's suppliers

34
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,010
and their performance
are managed appropriately

35
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,607
to support the provision of
seamless, quality products,

36
00:01:23,607 --> 00:01:25,970
services and components.

37
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,960
Keep that in mind for the
exam and you'll do great

38
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,893
on any supplier management questions.
