1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:02,310
- Back when you attended
school as a child,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,764
you may have learned about
the industrial revolution.

3
00:00:04,764 --> 00:00:07,160
The first industrial
revolution occurred in the

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,030
18th and 19th centuries, all
across Europe and America.

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,120
During this period, humanity moved from

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,297
an agrarian-based rural society of farmers

7
00:00:15,297 --> 00:00:17,960
into an urbanized, industrial area,

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,960
that later developed into

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,100
some of our country's largest cities.

10
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,120
This movement was brought
about by the development

11
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,710
of mechanization in the form
of iron and textile industries,

12
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,220
as well a the power of the steam engine

13
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,130
for our transportation needs.

14
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,980
The industrial revolution was
only the first one though,

15
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,610
by the end of the 19th century,

16
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,440
and continuing until World War I,

17
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,923
or the Great War, as it's known in Europe,

18
00:00:37,923 --> 00:00:41,239
humanity moved into the
second industrial revolution.

19
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:43,570
During this time, our industries expanded

20
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,360
to include steel, oil, electricity,

21
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,270
and electrically-powered equipment to aid

22
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,070
in the mass production of goods.

23
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,270
During this time period,
cars were developed

24
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,910
with their internal combustion engines,

25
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,120
that made transportation even
more convenient and efficient.

26
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,840
At the same time, the light bulb

27
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,220
began to replace candlelight,

28
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,510
allowing us to work longer into the night.

29
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,290
And of course, communication
across great distances,

30
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,250
became possible through
the use of our telephones.

31
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,800
Life was better than it
had ever been before,

32
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,050
but humanity wasn't done
exploring and inventing yet.

33
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,350
Technology continued to expand in its use,

34
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,250
but there weren't any
real major breakthroughs

35
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,490
until the end of the 20th century.

36
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,780
It was around 1980 and technology

37
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,720
had jumped to yet another level.

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,055
This was way beyond what existed in the

39
00:01:26,055 --> 00:01:28,020
second industrial revolution.

40
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,990
It was at this time that the
third industrial revolution,

41
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,010
known as the digital
revolution, truly began.

42
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,590
With the advancement of analog
and digital electronics,

43
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,160
humanity began to utilize
life-changing technologies

44
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,100
on a daily basis, including
the personal computer,

45
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,050
the internet, and the entire spectrum

46
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,510
of information and
communication technologies.

47
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,880
Many of these things are the things

48
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,070
you're responsible for
within your organization,

49
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,360
and it was during this
third industrial revolution

50
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,986
that ITIL was first created.

51
00:01:53,986 --> 00:01:56,290
ITIL was first developed as a series of

52
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,362
best practices and guidance

53
00:01:57,362 --> 00:02:00,950
on how to run an information
technology organization.

54
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,520
In fact, ITIL, as it was
originally developed,

55
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,840
was an acronym that stood for

56
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,600
Information Technology
Infrastructure Library.

57
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,390
ITIL began in the 1980s
as a way for organizations

58
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,050
to create processes and procedures

59
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,110
to better run their IT systems.

60
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,463
Throughout the last three decades,

61
00:02:15,463 --> 00:02:17,580
ITIL became the defacto standard

62
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,350
around the world for
IT service management.

63
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,970
As we moved as a society from the

64
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,010
first industrial
revolution, to the second,

65
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,380
and then onto the third,

66
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,550
we're now at a crossroads again.

67
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,410
Now, we're moving into the
fourth industrial revolution,

68
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,690
and it is happening right now.

69
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,520
The fourth industrial revolution is marked

70
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,770
by the creation of cyber-physical systems,

71
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,070
where a fusion of technologies
has blurred the lines

72
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,360
between physical and digital realms.

73
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,980
This includes the use of technologies like

74
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,960
robotics, nanotechnology,

75
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,290
artificial intelligence,
the internet of things,

76
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,548
autonomous cars, and so much more.

77
00:02:49,548 --> 00:02:51,480
This explosive growth in technology

78
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,930
in the early 21st century has transformed

79
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,460
our world economies, as well as ourselves.

80
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,120
So, you may be wondering right now,

81
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,860
'Why are we spending time
talking about the history

82
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,000
of various industrial
revolutions that occurred

83
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,930
over the past few hundred years?'

84
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,810
Well, it's to make this point:

85
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,180
ITIL 4 is not considered ITIL version 4,

86
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,240
instead it's ITIL for the
fourth industrial revolution.

87
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,531
ITIL is no longer considered an acronym.

88
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:18,370
ITIL is a brand name.

89
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,460
It simply means ITIL, it doesn't mean

90
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,270
Information Technology
Infrastructure Library anymore,

91
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,650
because ITIL is more
than just infrastructure.

92
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,080
This is a major shift in
the way ITIL approaches

93
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,090
the challenges of IT service management

94
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,370
based on this as well.
