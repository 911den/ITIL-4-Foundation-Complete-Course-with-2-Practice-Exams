1
00:00:00,129 --> 00:00:02,750
- ITIL was first created around the idea

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,780
how to conduct service management
within our organizations.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,200
So, it should be no surprise

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,620
that we have a specific definition

5
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,950
of what is considered a service.

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,200
The definition of a service

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,520
is something you should be
able to recall for the exam,

8
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,130
as well as understand it.

9
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,520
According to ITIL four,

10
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,490
a service is a means of
enabling value co-creation

11
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,217
by facilitating outcomes that
the customer wants to achieve,

12
00:00:23,217 --> 00:00:25,400
without that customer having to manage

13
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,820
the specific costs and risks.

14
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,870
Now, let's dig into this
definition one piece at a time.

15
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,170
First, service is a means of
enabling value co-creation.

16
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,480
This portion of the definition

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,880
is a reference back to
how value is determined

18
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,400
as a result of the relationship

19
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,040
between the provider of the service

20
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,650
and the customer of the service.

21
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,210
Next, the second portion
of the definition says

22
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,740
that this is done by facilitating outcomes

23
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,620
that customers want to achieve.

24
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,250
Again, this goes back
to the concept of value.

25
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,380
If I'm giving you something
as a service provider

26
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,200
that doesn't help you as the customer,

27
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,820
to achieve your objectives,

28
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,820
well, then it doesn't have any value.

29
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,140
So, going back to the earlier
example of this course,

30
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,510
if it doesn't help you pass
your certification exam,

31
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,710
then the value hasn't been co-created.

32
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,430
After all, the service provider

33
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,350
can't achieve your objectives for you.

34
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,410
You have to achieve them yourself.

35
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,800
The service provider is
only able to facilitate

36
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,410
the achievement of
those customer outcomes.

37
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,810
After all, you have to pass the exam.

38
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,251
I can only provide you with the tools

39
00:01:22,251 --> 00:01:23,900
and the resources you need,

40
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,200
to be successful.

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,340
The same holds true with I-T services.

42
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,270
I can ensure your computer is
up and able to run a program.

43
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,140
But if you don't provide

44
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,686
the necessary inputs to that program,

45
00:01:32,686 --> 00:01:35,432
you're going to be unable
to get the necessary outputs

46
00:01:35,432 --> 00:01:37,900
and eventually the outcomes you desire.

47
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,300
Now, the final portion of
this service definition

48
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,179
states that this
co-created value is created

49
00:01:42,179 --> 00:01:44,069
without the customer having to manage

50
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:45,950
specific costs and risks.

51
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,810
This refers to the whole
reason why a customer hires

52
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,030
a service provider in the first place.

53
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,050
For example, I'm a customer
of a web-hosting company

54
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,750
that hosts all of my training videos.

55
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,390
So, my organization pays
this web-hosting company

56
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,709
a monthly fee for hosting
terabytes of video files for us.

57
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:03,193
And in exchange for that service,

58
00:02:03,193 --> 00:02:05,347
we pay them a nominal monthly fee.

59
00:02:05,347 --> 00:02:07,431
It's their job as the service provider

60
00:02:07,431 --> 00:02:09,100
to manage all the specific

61
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,437
costs and risks associated
with that service.

62
00:02:11,437 --> 00:02:14,520
For example, our contract
allows for unlimited

63
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,090
data storage on their servers

64
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,940
and unlimited bandwidth to be used,

65
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,915
without incurring any additional

66
00:02:18,915 --> 00:02:21,420
cost to us under our contract.

67
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,850
Because we negotiate a fixed-fee contract.

68
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,840
Now, my company employs a
lot of very technical folks.

69
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,170
I personally have been responsible

70
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,900
for running hundreds of web servers,

71
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,340
domain controllers, mail
servers and file servers

72
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,340
throughout my career.

73
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,393
So, why doesn't Dion Training maintain

74
00:02:35,393 --> 00:02:37,230
and host our own web servers

75
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,067
to host all of our video training courses?

76
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:40,560
Well, simply put,

77
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,960
we don't want to have
to deal with the cost

78
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,260
and the risk of providing
that particular service.

79
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,460
It just isn't the business
that we're in anymore, right?

80
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,340
Instead, we're focused on training.

81
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,140
Our business is all about training,

82
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,170
not running these large server farms.

83
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,580
So, we don't want to have to deal

84
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,717
with the patching, the
updating, the back-ups,

85
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,550
scaling up and scaling down

86
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,710
based on low demands and all of that.

87
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,857
Instead, for negotiating flat-fee
with our service provider,

88
00:03:02,857 --> 00:03:05,890
we can take all of those
costs and risks from us,

89
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,180
and we can simply pay our contracted rate.

90
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,120
And the service provider
gets to deal with it.

91
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,646
This is exactly what the service
definition is referring to.

92
00:03:12,646 --> 00:03:14,240
So, let's take a look

93
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,810
at that service definition one more time.

94
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,010
A service is a means of
enabling value co-creation

95
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,820
by facilitating outcomes that
customers want to achieve,

96
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,400
without the customer having to manage

97
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,490
specific costs and risks.

98
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,250
So, in addition to services,

99
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,743
a service organization can
actually provide services

100
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:33,310
based on products that they have as well.

101
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,190
Now, a product is a configuration

102
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,960
of an organization's resources

103
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,470
that's designed to offer
value for a consumer.

104
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,910
I like to think of this as
the collection of services

105
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,070
that were put together to give more value

106
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,670
than they could individually.

107
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,990
Now, every organization works
with a set of resources.

108
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,570
These resources are either
owned by the organizations,

109
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,870
belong to the organization,

110
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,870
or, are managed by the organization.

111
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,420
These resources may even
be supporting services

112
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,680
provided by the organization
suppliers and their partners.

113
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,270
These resources can be leased or rented.

114
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,230
These resources could even be the people

115
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,320
who work in an organization
under a contractual agreement.

116
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,020
Because these people are a resource

117
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,780
to the organization, too.

118
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,780
Now, the way an organization configures

119
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,737
all those resources into a set offering

120
00:04:15,737 --> 00:04:18,220
is the essence of a product.

121
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,420
For example, Amazon Web Services or A-W-S,

122
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,390
has a lot of different service offerings.

123
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,130
Including server-hosting,
under their E-C-two brand.

124
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,610
File storage, under S-three.

125
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,180
Domain name server
systems, under Route 53.

126
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,390
And many others.

127
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,334
But, these services,

128
00:04:33,334 --> 00:04:36,130
they aren't necessarily
considered products.

129
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,328
Now, if you compare
these individual services

130
00:04:38,328 --> 00:04:40,870
with the Amazon Lightsail product,

131
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,970
you can see how Amazon has
combined their E-C-two,

132
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,068
their S-three and their Route 53 services

133
00:04:46,068 --> 00:04:48,460
into a single product that can be sold

134
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,610
directly to a customer in
a defined configuration.

135
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,080
Everything that makes up Lightsail

136
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,070
is available as a service
individually from A-W-S.

137
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,720
But when combined under
the Lightsail product,

138
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,530
Amazon removed a lot of the
complexity and confusion

139
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,250
associated with that typical
new-customers' journey,

140
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,887
into the A-W-S and into cloud computing.

141
00:05:06,887 --> 00:05:09,380
So, I know, we covered
a lot in this lesson.

142
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,970
But there's two key definitions

143
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,760
that we covered that you need to know.

144
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,320
First, is service.

145
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,200
A service is a means of
enabling value co-creation

146
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,010
by facilitating outcomes that
the customer wants to achieve,

147
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,640
without the customer having to manage

148
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,890
those specific costs and risks.

149
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,830
And the second one, is a product.

150
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,720
A product is simply a configuration

151
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,540
of an organization's resources

152
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,986
designed to offer value for a consumer.

153
00:05:31,986 --> 00:05:34,230
Keep those two definitions in your head

154
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,130
because you're going to need 'em,

155
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:35,963
come test day.
