1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,560
- Congratulations you did it,

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,410
you've reached the end of the course.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,730
Together, we have spent a lot of time

4
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,330
as we've gone through 100 lessons

5
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,460
of videos and quizzes to teach you

6
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,070
everything you need to know
for the ITIL 4 Foundation exam.

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,400
Now, if you're like most students

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,800
you're getting ready to go take that exam,

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,490
what should you being doing now?

10
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,960
First, you should make sure
you have that study guide

11
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,720
from lesson one of the course.

12
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,370
In there we have all of
the definitions you need,

13
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,640
and all of the purposes
and all of the terms

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,010
that are memorization items,

15
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,290
as well as all of our
notes from the course.

16
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,900
If you've been following
along as we've gone through

17
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,160
the course and that guide,
you've probably highlighted it

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,450
and taken notes, which is great.

19
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,110
Then, I want you to take
some practice exams.

20
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,510
I've included a couple
of them in this course

21
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,180
and I want you to make
sure you're taking those

22
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,560
and seeing where you score.

23
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,580
If you're scoring 75%, or 80%, or higher,

24
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,670
you're ready to take the
real certification exam.

25
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,400
If you're not, you may want to get

26
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,190
a couple more practice
exams and keep practicing,

27
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,150
because that exam is expensive

28
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,110
and so another 10 or $15
to get some practice exams

29
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,500
might be worthwhile so
you can practice more

30
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,120
with some new questions.

31
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,730
Once you feel confident, I
want you to get your voucher

32
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,150
and schedule your exam.

33
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,100
Set a date in stone so you know
when you're going to take it.

34
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,240
That will help you study
better and more efficiently.

35
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,650
As I said back in our
first lesson together,

36
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,840
we're always going back
and improving this course

37
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,550
based on the feedback of our students.

38
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,240
If I didn't explain something well enough

39
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,940
or go into enough depth
based on the exam you took,

40
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,720
please let me know
because we're constantly

41
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,300
adding more to this course to make it

42
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,920
the best course there is for
anyone studying for ITIL 4.

43
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,720
So, once you pass the exam,
let me know how you did,

44
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,190
I'd love to hear about it,

45
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,473
and I hope to see you in a
future course, good luck!
