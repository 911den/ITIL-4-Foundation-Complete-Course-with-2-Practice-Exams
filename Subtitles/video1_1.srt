1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,960
- Welcome to the complete course

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,190
for the ITIL 4 Foundation
certification exam.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,670
In this course, you're going to learn

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,810
everything you need to
know to take and pass

5
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,860
the ITIL 4 Foundation exam
on your first attempt.

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,810
In addition to that,
you're going to be exposed

7
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,700
to the entire ITIL 4 framework.

8
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,180
So you can learn how to best use it

9
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,820
within your organization.

10
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,290
So whether you're taking this course

11
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,110
to learn about the ITIL 4 framework

12
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,880
or you're taking this
course to prepare for

13
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,250
the certification exam
so you can get a new job

14
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,120
or advance in your current organization.

15
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,300
This course has been designed specifically

16
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,380
to teach you everything
covered in the official

17
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,850
ITIL Foundation textbook

18
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,930
and it's designed as a
complete textbook replacement.

19
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,160
Now before we dive into
the course materials

20
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,590
let me provide you with a
quick introduction to ITIL.

21
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,280
If your boss enrolled you in this course

22
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,400
you may not even know
what ITIL is all about

23
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,950
or what it's used for.

24
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,530
Well, ITIL is a framework
for service management.

25
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,967
But I guess that begs the question,

26
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,540
"What exactly is service management?"

27
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,050
Well service management
is a set of specialized

28
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,760
organizational capabilities
for enabling value

29
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,160
to customers in the form of services.

30
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,240
We're going to talk a lot
about service management

31
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,730
throughout this entire course.

32
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,100
In fact, the entirety of Section Two

33
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,870
is dedicated to the topic
of Service Management.

34
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,180
Now ITIL was designed
to provide organizations

35
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,600
with a comprehensive framework
for IT service management.

36
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,690
In fact, ITIL is the most popular

37
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,820
and widely used information technology

38
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,790
service management framework
in the entire world.

39
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,750
It's one of the reasons
that ITIL Foundation

40
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,610
has such a high demand,
because most large companies

41
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,620
have built their IT
service management systems

42
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,450
and processes around the idea and concepts

43
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,080
of the ITIL framework.

44
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,200
Now I know I've gotten you
excited about ITIL, hopefully

45
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,580
and I need to take just a
small detour in the course

46
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,710
to introduce myself and share
with you four important tips

47
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,340
to help you learn better
during our time together.

48
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,530
Now first, my name is Jason Dion

49
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:50,600
and I'm the lead instructor
here at Dion Training Solutions.

50
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,140
I've been working in the
IT and cyber security field

51
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:57,190
for over two decades for
organizations both large and small.

52
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,930
In all of these organizations though

53
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,930
there's been one common
thread and that's ITIL.

54
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,100
Now when I'm talking
about small organizations

55
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,570
I'm talking about companies
with less than 20 people.

56
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,360
Small companies like my own.

57
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,370
When I talk about large organizations

58
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,350
I'm thinking about some
of my previous positions.

59
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:15,070
My last one in particular
I was with an organization

60
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,870
that spanned six continents,
dozens of countries

61
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,450
and millions of end users.

62
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:23,230
And guess what, all of these
organizations they ran on ITIL.

63
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,940
So I'm not just an instructor,

64
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,590
I'm also a practitioner of ITIL.

65
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,540
And I've been using it for decades.

66
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,140
Now rest assured you are
in great hands with us.

67
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,770
In fact, I'm an authorized
instructor for ITIL

68
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,490
and my company is an accredited
training organization

69
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,640
for PeopleCert on behalf of AXELOS,

70
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,330
the creators of the ITIL framework

71
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,010
and the certification exams.

72
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,760
In fact because we're an ATO,

73
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,000
all of our courses are reviewed by AXELOS

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,590
prior to us releasing them to you.

75
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,620
And this ensures that you're getting

76
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,530
the quality training
required to pass the exam.

77
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,237
And now for my four tips
for success in this course.

78
00:02:54,237 --> 00:02:56,590
First every video in this course

79
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,400
has the ability for you to
turn on closed captioning.

80
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,610
Each video is captioned
by a real live human

81
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,090
and checked for accuracy.

82
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,920
This allows you to read
along with the course

83
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,090
if you need to.

84
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,690
Many of my students who speak English

85
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,270
as their second language, really
love having those captions

86
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,640
playing along with the videos
and this helps them aid

87
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,650
in their learning and understanding.

88
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,540
Now if you want to enable closed captions

89
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,050
simply click on the CC button

90
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,687
in the bottom of the video player.

91
00:03:19,687 --> 00:03:22,430
My second tip is about playback speed.

92
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,700
I've gotten some students
who say I talk too fast.

93
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,900
I have others who say I talk too slow.

94
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,710
Either way, you get to control
the speed of the instruction

95
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,100
by clicking on the 1x button

96
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,760
in the bottom of the video player.

97
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,190
If you want me to teach faster,

98
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,510
simply select 1.25x or 1.5x.

99
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,770
If you want me to teach slower

100
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,740
simply click .75 or .5x.

101
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,070
Either way, faster or
slower, the choice is yours.

102
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,370
The third and probably one
of the most important tips

103
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,350
is about our student support group.

104
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,620
We have a student support group

105
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,250
with several thousand other students

106
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,160
who are learning ITIL and other IT

107
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,760
and project management certifications

108
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,100
through all of our courses.

109
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,510
If you want to join the fun there

110
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,850
you can find us at
facebook.com/groups/diontraining

111
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,080
and you can request to
join our private group.

112
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,070
There's not extra cost to
you by joining this group

113
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,650
and it's there to help you.

114
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,480
In this group, we answer questions,

115
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,910
put out additional free content

116
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,650
and help support each other
through our IT careers.

117
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,560
So if you want to ask a question there

118
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,040
all you have to do is post it

119
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,500
and you'll likely get an answer
within just a few minutes

120
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,480
because most of the time,
there are thousands of

121
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,510
other students, both past and present

122
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,440
who join the conversations there.

123
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,850
So if you're on Facebook,

124
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,310
I highly recommend
joining the group today.

125
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,800
Now if you aren't on Facebook,

126
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,450
you can still ask your questions

127
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,250
if you get stuck during this course.

128
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,860
Simply click on the Q and A tab
of your course learning page

129
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,410
and enter your question there.

130
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,080
Either myself or one of my team members

131
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,390
will answer your question there

132
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,700
within one to two days in most cases.

133
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,210
Like I said, the Facebook group,

134
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,020
you're going to get something
answered much quicker

135
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,350
because we have thousands of
people there to support you.

136
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,810
If you do it here in the Q and A

137
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,150
you'll get an answer once we
get back to work the next day

138
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,700
and we can help you out.

139
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,110
Now the fourth and final tip

140
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,810
is that this course comes with
a downloadable study guide

141
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,640
as a complete resource for you.

142
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,640
You can download this PDF and
it's attached to this lesson.

143
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,210
To access it, simply download
it from the resources

144
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,300
in this lesson and then
you can print it out

145
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,300
and refer to it during
your offline studies

146
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,453
and as you go through
the rest of this course.
