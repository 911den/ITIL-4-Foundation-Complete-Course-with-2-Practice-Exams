1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,460
- Let's discuss a few details

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,670
about the ITIL 4 Foundation exam.

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,110
If you're like most of my students,

4
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,400
you're probably taking this course

5
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,380
because you want to become
ITIL 4 Foundation certified.

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,240
Maybe you're working
towards a certification

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,810
to advancing your current career

8
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,850
or maybe it's because you're
trying to get your first job

9
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,900
in the information technology field.

10
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,330
Either way, this course
is designed to help teach

11
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,520
you everything you need to know
in order to pass that exam.

12
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,850
To help you focus your studies
throughout the course though

13
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,190
it's important for you to understand

14
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,070
how the exam is designed.

15
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,370
The questions on the
ITIL 4 exam are focused

16
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,960
on you having the ability
to recall or understand

17
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,820
the concepts from this course.

18
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,560
Now, the word recall and
understand are the keywords here.

19
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,320
If a question is focused on your ability

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,510
to recall something,

21
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,850
this means you have to be
able to identify a definition

22
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,620
or a term from the
answer choices provided.

23
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,450
For example, if the exam
provide you with a definition

24
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,630
for a particular term
that we use in the course,

25
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,400
it's going to provide it to
you word for word the same way

26
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,350
we presented it inside the course

27
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,440
and then you're going to be provided

28
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,440
with four different terms
and you have to select

29
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,610
the appropriate term that
matches the definition given.

30
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,840
Now, this is a great
example of a question using

31
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,850
the recall level of difficulty.

32
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:09,450
On the exam, you're going
to get nine questions

33
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,640
that are considered recall questions.

34
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,220
For that reason, it's really
important to be familiar

35
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,570
with the definitions that
we present in this course.

36
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,580
All of these definitions
are provided to you

37
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,390
in the downloadable study guide

38
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,240
and they're going to be
displayed on the screen

39
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,230
whenever I'm teaching them to you.

40
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,190
Now, if a question is
focused on your ability

41
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,780
to understand something, this
means you have to be able

42
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,710
to describe or explain
the definition of term

43
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,470
or a concept based on
the answers provided.

44
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,520
For these questions,

45
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,220
the exam isn't looking
for an exact word match.

46
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,500
Instead, you might get
an example of something

47
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,790
and you have to determine
the correct ITIL practice

48
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,720
or term that relates to it.

49
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,620
If you pay close attention to this course,

50
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,620
you're going to learn
the concepts of ITIL 4

51
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,550
and be able to answer
those questions on the exam

52
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,300
without too much difficulty.

53
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,710
Now, how do you take the
official certification exam

54
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,380
and become ITIL 4 Foundation certified?

55
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,100
Well, Acellus and PeopleCert
make it quite easy

56
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,240
because you don't even have
to get in your car and drive

57
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,420
to a testing center like many
other certification exams.

58
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,070
Instead, you're able
to take the exam online

59
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,170
from the comfort of
your own home or office

60
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,900
using the PeopleCert
web proctoring service.

61
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,900
To schedule your exam, you do
need an exam voucher though

62
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,220
because this covers the cost

63
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,390
of the certification exam itself.

64
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,760
You can buy the exam voucher
directly from PeopleCert

65
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,700
on their website at a
cost of $349 or you can go

66
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,270
to diontraining.com and
purchase your exam voucher

67
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,190
at a special discount rate
of $299 that's available

68
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,480
just for my students.

69
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,350
Because we're an authorized
training organization

70
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,990
for ITIL 4 Foundations,

71
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,190
we're able to buy these vouchers in bulk

72
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,380
and we pass the savings
on to our students.

73
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,890
Now, once you order your vouchers
is delivered to your email

74
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,130
within about 10 minutes
and you can then schedule

75
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,470
your certification exam
for the day and time

76
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,970
that's most convenient for you.

77
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,410
So, now that you know what
to study in terms of recall

78
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,810
and understanding and you
know where to buy your voucher

79
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,200
and how to schedule
your exam, what's next?

80
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,360
Well, let's talk about the exam itself.

81
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,080
There's some key facts and
figures that you need to know.

82
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,860
First, the exam is timed.

83
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,490
You're going to get 60
minutes to take the exam.

84
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,530
Now, if you're not a
native English speaker

85
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,670
but you're taking the exam in English,

86
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,380
you can go ahead and get
an extra 15 minutes of time

87
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,350
on the exam if you request
it during your scheduling.

88
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,610
This will bring your time up to 75 minutes

89
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,230
if you request a time
extension from PeopleCert.

90
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,310
Now, for all of us
English speakers though,

91
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,200
we only get 60 minutes.

92
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,660
Don't worry though, 60
minutes is plenty of time

93
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,850
for this exam.

94
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,920
Most of my students finish
in about 30 minutes.

95
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,660
Now, as for the questions,
the exam only has 40 questions

96
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,060
and the exam contains only
multiple choice questions

97
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,270
on the exam.

98
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,610
So, again, this exam is about
recalling an understanding

99
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,730
not memorization and not
comprehension in depth.

100
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,400
So, you won't have to write
out a definition word for word

101
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,330
or pull up an answer out of thin air.

102
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,390
Instead, it's always an
a, b, c, or d choice.

103
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,770
To pass the certification,

104
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,880
you have to answer at least 26 questions

105
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,450
out of 40 correctly.

106
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,720
This equates to a 65% or
higher on the exam for you

107
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,720
to pass it and earn your
ITIL 4 certification.

108
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,310
To best prepare for the exam,

109
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,080
I recommend you take a
lot of practice exams.

110
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,500
We've included quiz questions

111
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,560
and two full length practice
exams with this course.

112
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,210
When you're taking a practice exam,

113
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:19,060
I recommend aiming for 75%
or higher to consider it

114
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,290
a pass because this will give
you at least a 10% buffer

115
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,280
in case you ended up having a bad test day

116
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,230
or you get nervous when
taking a timed test

117
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,150
or certification exam.

118
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,600
Now, this is because every
time you take the exam

119
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,990
you have to buy a new voucher

120
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,210
and you only want to have to take it once.

121
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,850
Now, I've said you're going to
get 40 questions on exam day

122
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,520
and they're all multiple choice,

123
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,420
but they are made up of
three different types

124
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,050
of multiple choice questions.

125
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,420
We call these classic
missing word and list.

126
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,110
Let's take a look at each of these.

127
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,060
First, we have a classic question.

128
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,120
For example, which character
was created by Walt Disney?

129
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,790
A, Bart Simpson, b, Mickey Mouse,

130
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,520
c, Fred Flintstone or d, Garfield?

131
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,810
Well, if you know cartoons,

132
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,530
you probably know the
answer is b, Mickey Mouse.

133
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,050
Now, you may see a few
classic questions on the exam

134
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,800
that are shown is what we call
a negative classic question.

135
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,570
This is symbolized by the
word not in the question.

136
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,470
So, if you're asked
something like which of these

137
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,030
is not a car brand?

138
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,060
A, Ford, b, Saturn, c, Cisco or d, Toyota.

139
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,820
You hopefully realize that
Cisco is not a car brand

140
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,650
but instead is networking gear.

141
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,740
In fact, Cisco is a very popular brand

142
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,030
of networking equipment but
the other three are car brands.

143
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,520
So, we would say Cisco is the
right answer in this case.

144
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,170
The next type of question is what we call

145
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,860
a missing word question.

146
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,350
On the exam, this is
shown by a question mark

147
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,280
that would represent a
single word or a short phrase

148
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,630
of two, three or four words.

149
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:45,200
For example, a or and
blank is a type of fruit.

150
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,800
Is it a, apple b, carrot,
c, onion or d, celery?

151
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,960
Well, the answer is a,
apple because b, c and d

152
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,730
are all types of vegetables.

153
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,480
This makes the sentence read
as an apple is a type of fruit.

154
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,450
Our final type of question is what's known

155
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,860
as a list question.

156
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,710
You're probably going to
only see one or two of these

157
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,000
on your ITIL 4 Foundation exam though.

158
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,040
These questions ask it so that
more than one correct answer

159
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,300
can be provided.

160
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,540
So, you're going to get a numbered list

161
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,880
and you'll have to choose the right answer

162
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,320
that represents two of
the correct list items.

163
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,930
For example, which ingredients
are in a PB&J sandwich?

164
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,230
One, peanut butter, two,
apples, three, bacon

165
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,810
or four, grape jelly.

166
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,640
Well, as a parent who made
a lot of PB&J sandwiches

167
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,473
in my life,

168
00:06:27,473 --> 00:06:29,620
I can tell you that the answer is one,

169
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,560
peanut butter and four, Jelly.

170
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,810
So we have to find the
letter that corresponds

171
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,470
with answers, one and four in it,

172
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,170
which in this case is d, and
that becomes our answer choice.
