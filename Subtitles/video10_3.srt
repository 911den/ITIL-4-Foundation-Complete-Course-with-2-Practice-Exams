1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,760
- Infrastructure and Platform Management.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,440
Now, this practice is another one

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,970
you do not need to know for the exam.

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,650
But instead, we are going to cover it

5
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,210
so you at least have heard about it,

6
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,720
and you'll understand it a little bit

7
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,500
if somebody asks you about it.

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,040
When we talk about the infrastructure

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,690
and platform management practice,

10
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,550
it's really responsible for overseeing

11
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,450
the infrastructure and the platforms

12
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,520
that are used by the organization.

13
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,670
Now, what this really means

14
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,160
is that it's going to
enable the monitoring

15
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,180
of the technology solutions
that are available,

16
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,320
including solutions from third-parties.

17
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,750
So when I think about the
platform or the infrastructure,

18
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,390
I think about the servers, the software,

19
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,620
the network, all of that stuff.

20
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,180
Well, the people who are monitoring it

21
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,750
to make sure it's up and working properly,

22
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,930
that is part of infrastructure
and platform management.

23
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,850
This tends to be a very technical domain,

24
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,140
and it's one that's covered
by technical personnel

25
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,640
who are responsible to make sure

26
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,840
the systems are
up-and-running at all times.

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,330
Normally, this is people inside

28
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,890
your network operations center

29
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,927
or your security operations center.
