1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,690
- In this lesson, we're
going to discuss costs.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,020
Now, the cost of something
is the amount of money

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,030
that spent on a particular activity or

4
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,590
a particular resource.

5
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,040
While cost is usually
expressed financially,

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,290
it can also be expressed
in nonfinancial ways too.

7
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,740
For example, when we
create a new course here,

8
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,710
we actually measure the cost of the course

9
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,840
in the number of hours spent creating it.

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,470
A typical course, like this one,

11
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,170
might require 400 or 500
hours worth of effort

12
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,130
across our entire staff.

13
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,040
This usually is described
in either the measurement

14
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,827
of man hours, or FTE.

15
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,610
Man hours are also known as person hours,

16
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,900
because we want to be
equal opportunist here.

17
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,250
FTEs, on the other hand,

18
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,000
stands for Full Time Equivalent.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,120
And it's used to measure
things based on a single

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,440
employee, who works 40 hours per week,

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,850
for an entire year.

22
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,800
This equates to roughly
2,000 hours worth of work.

23
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,310
So, if we need to run a web server

24
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,880
to host all of our courses,

25
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,550
that might require half of an FTE.

26
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,830
Or one-half of a person's
annual available work hours

27
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,360
for the entire year.

28
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,440
This describes the number of FTEs, or

29
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,830
Full Time Equivalent
employees that are required

30
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,410
in order to undertake
a particular activity.

31
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,630
Now, while I can measure
things from a an hours

32
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,970
of effort perspective,

33
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,190
this does ultimately translate
back to financial cost.

34
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,580
Each team member on my
team earns a salary.

35
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,330
And if it takes somebody
half of their entire year

36
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,570
to run that web server,

37
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,238
that means half of their salary is tied up

38
00:01:22,238 --> 00:01:24,640
in keeping that web server up and running.

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,890
So, it does end up going
back to cost eventually.

40
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,220
But, when we look at our reports,

41
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,690
we're actually more
concerned with the amount

42
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,770
of time things take,
than the amount of money

43
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,890
we spend on 'em.

44
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,740
Now, depending on your organization,

45
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,170
you may choose to measure things based

46
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,130
on the man hours, the
person hours, the FTEs,

47
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,380
or using actual dollar and
cents that are expended.

48
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,270
Either way, the service provider is aiming

49
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,930
to reduce or remove costs,

50
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,580
when they provide a service.

51
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,920
So, if a service provider
can save you more money

52
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,630
than their service is going to cost you,

53
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,810
you're certainly going to look at using

54
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,030
that service, right?

55
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,470
I know I would.

56
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,320
For example,

57
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,980
my internet service provider
has varying speeds available,

58
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,150
that we can choose to
use here at our office.

59
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,890
We can choose to spend $50
per month for 100 megabit

60
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,910
per second connection.

61
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,500
Or, $100 a month for a 1,000 megabit per

62
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,570
second connection.

63
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,020
Which one should we choose?

64
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,100
Well, in our case, we
upload a lot of large files,

65
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,990
because of all the videos that we produce.

66
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,220
And when we looked at the speed that we

67
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,100
were going to purchase,

68
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,780
we decided that paying twice
as much money per month,

69
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,810
for a ten-times increase in
speed, was well worth it.

70
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,920
Because it saves our staff a lot of time

71
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,320
uploading those files.

72
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,140
So, it became an easy decision.

73
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,160
Because spending $50 more per month on the

74
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,560
faster internet connection,

75
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,610
made my staff much more productive.

76
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,110
And it saved us a lot
of wasted labor hours.

77
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,560
And this more than made
up for the additional cost

78
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,690
in the labor savings
that we were able to get.

79
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,460
That's the idea when you look at costs.

80
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,940
If you're going to outsource a service,

81
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,290
or you're going to pay for something,

82
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,180
you want to make sure
it's giving you more value

83
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,580
than what it's costing you.

84
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,970
In our case, spending
twice as much on internet,

85
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,600
gave us 10 times more value.

86
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,450
And so it was definitely worth doing.
