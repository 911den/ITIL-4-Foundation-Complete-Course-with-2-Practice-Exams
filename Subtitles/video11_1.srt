1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,750
- We've come a long way
throughout this course,

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,640
and in this lesson, I want
to put it all together.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,960
We started out talking about our

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,820
four dimensions of service management,

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,810
which include organizations and people,

6
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:13,270
information and technology,

7
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,420
partners and suppliers,

8
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,590
and the value stream and processes.

9
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,850
Then, we talked about the
ITIL service value system.

10
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,510
This included our opportunity
and demands as our input,

11
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,810
and those are shaped by
our service value chain,

12
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,900
our governance, our practices,
our guiding principles,

13
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,410
and our continual improvement,

14
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,070
and out the other side, we got value.

15
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,490
Now, we also dug into the
service value chain itself,

16
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,530
as part of the service value system.

17
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,770
We explored the different
parts of it, like engage, plan,

18
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,020
improve, design and
transition, obtain and build,

19
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,950
deliver and support, and
our products and services.

20
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,930
And then, we spent the last
three sections of the course

21
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,010
looking at the 34 different
practices across ITIL 4.

22
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,760
But now, it's time for us
to put it all together.

23
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,860
So let's walk through
a real-world scenario

24
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,720
with an incident that
needs to be resolved,

25
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,800
and see how everything
we talked about so far

26
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,135
will be integrated together
to create the desired value.

27
00:01:05,135 --> 00:01:08,600
Now, let's pretend we work
for a large logistics company,

28
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,210
something like Walmart or
Amazon, and we're part of

29
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,350
their IT service management
organization within the company.

30
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,710
They have a warehouse
that uses a wifi network

31
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,520
in order to allow the forklift driver

32
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,770
to receive instructions
on his mobile device

33
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,530
that tells him which aisle
and which rack the product is

34
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,330
that he needs to go pick up.

35
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,010
Unfortunately, the wireless
access point that supports

36
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,920
the wifi in this area of the warehouse

37
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,578
isn't working so well, and
so the driver's mobile device

38
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:34,940
can't get the information that he needs.

39
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,470
Now, this has a significant
impact on our business

40
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,740
because whenever that
forklift driver can't receive

41
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,070
the instructions quickly
enough, there's a risk

42
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,850
that a tight business
deadline might be missed.

43
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,100
After all, some companies like Amazon

44
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,720
rely on their super-fast shipping

45
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,290
as a core function of
their business model.

46
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,550
Now, while this may seem like

47
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,580
a relatively straightforward incident,

48
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,900
it can't be resolved simply
by following the steps

49
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,450
of a predetermined incident
management procedure.

50
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,670
Instead, there's a lot of interconnections

51
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,680
among the practices and the activities

52
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,670
for this wireless network to get fixed

53
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,970
and returned to normal operations.

54
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,810
So let's get started with the
service value system first.

55
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,760
First, we're going to see
that we have a demand,

56
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,730
and in this case, the warehouse manager

57
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,440
and the forklift driver
discovered the wifi coverage

58
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,490
isn't working properly
in a certain portion

59
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,710
of the warehouse.

60
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,920
This means the forklift
driver needs to drive

61
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,860
back to the manager's office
in between each pickup,

62
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,160
so he can find out the
location of his next product

63
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,410
within the warehouse.

64
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,700
This is causing delays,

65
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,210
and that could cause delivery
deadlines to be missed.

66
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,740
This is an incident.

67
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,760
From this demand, we now
move to the engage activity,

68
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,870
where the warehouse manager

69
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,880
is going to call up the service desk.

70
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,780
The service desk agent
listens to the issue

71
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,790
that's being described
by the warehouse manager,

72
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,480
they log it as an incident in
the incident management system

73
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,640
and they categorize that
incident as a high priority.

74
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,650
The agent then lets the
warehouse manager know

75
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,090
that they're going to
escalate the issue to

76
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,100
the technical support
team that's responsible

77
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,480
for that wireless network,
and they provide him updates

78
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,920
every two hours until that issue is fixed.

79
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,970
Now, the service desk
agent escalates the ticket

80
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,330
for the wireless network

81
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,730
up to the wireless network support team.

82
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,820
These are the folks who have
the delivery and support

83
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,580
function in the value chain activity

84
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,410
for this wireless network.

85
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,360
This allows the service
desk agent to provide

86
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,420
the information to the
network support engineer,

87
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,790
and the diagnosis and
analysis of the incident

88
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,210
is going to begin by that engineer.

89
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,830
Next, the network support
engineer identifies that

90
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,900
the wireless access point has failed,

91
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,750
and she decides to replace it with a spare

92
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,130
from the existing spare parts inventory.

93
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,470
This action alone is going
to involve several practices.

94
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,200
First, we have the IT
asset management practice,

95
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,760
so that she can update the serial number

96
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,800
in the configuration item database.

97
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,020
Then, she goes through

98
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,090
the service configuration
management practice,

99
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,810
because she needs to configure this device

100
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,750
based on the approved
baseline, and install it.

101
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,010
She's also going to go through
the change control practice,

102
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,820
since she's going to install
a new piece of equipment

103
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,670
into the network, and of course,

104
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,590
she's going to go through
incident management,

105
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,230
because she's working on
resolving an incident.

106
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,630
Let's assume that the replacement

107
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,660
of this wireless access
point is considered

108
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,010
a standard change, so no
additional approvals are needed.

109
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,390
If it was a normal change, then
we would have to go through

110
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,810
and get approval through the
change management process,

111
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,670
or escalate that issue
as an emergency change.

112
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,450
Either way, all of this would occur

113
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,600
within the change control
practice, though, right?

114
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,500
Finally, our network engineer
replaces the access point,

115
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,980
verifies that it's working,

116
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,470
and she updates the
incident management system.

117
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,850
She then calls the service
desk agent, and tells her

118
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,500
that she believes the
incident has been resolved.

119
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,480
Now that the engineer
has fixed the incident,

120
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,870
she sits back and thinks
about what happened,

121
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,590
and she thinks about
any possible ways that

122
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,570
she could have fixed
this more efficiently.

123
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,070
If she thinks of any, she might
add those to the continual

124
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,180
improvement register as suggestions
for future improvements.

125
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,030
If she does this, this becomes part of

126
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,690
continual improvement practice
and the improve activity.

127
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,580
Now, the service desk
agent, on the other hand,

128
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,450
goes back to the engage activity

129
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,470
by contacting the warehouse manager,

130
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,120
and she tells him that
the wireless network

131
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,640
should be working again.

132
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,220
She asks the manager to verify that

133
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,200
the forklift driver's mobile
phone is working again,

134
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,840
and gets the confirmation
of this, and when she does,

135
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,600
she can then close that incident fully.

136
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,300
Now, when we look at the final block

137
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,110
on the service value system, that's value.

138
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,110
The value's being co-created by ensuring

139
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,060
the wireless coverage is
restored, and the forklift driver

140
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,210
can now perform his job
more efficiently once again,

141
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,010
by using that mobile device
to identify the location

142
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,320
of the product that he
needs to pick up and move.

143
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,510
About an hour later, that
warehouse manager might receive

144
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:33,180
a brief email, asking for
a user satisfaction survey.

145
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,020
This might ask for his
feedback on the incident

146
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,410
and its resolution.

147
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,270
This would become an engage
activity again, right?

148
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,800
Well, if he fills out the
survey, we can then take that

149
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,420
and based on the feedback
received, we can identify

150
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,240
trends and patterns based
on satisfaction scores

151
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,820
in the user's comments.

152
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,560
This would fall under our improve area,

153
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,680
and we're going to be determining
if our incident management

154
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,730
system and our processes
are working effectively.

155
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,340
So, that was a lot.

156
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,410
As you can see, all of this ties together,

157
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,340
and we enter and leave
different activities

158
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,260
and different practices all
throughout this single incident

159
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,900
and its single resolution.

160
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,470
It isn't a simply linear
process, but instead,

161
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,850
we're bounced from engage
to the deliver and support,

162
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,120
back to engage, over to improve,
and many other practices,

163
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,820
several times during this quick example.

164
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,920
Remember, identifying and understanding

165
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,320
all of these interconnections
is the key to establishing

166
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,140
and promoting good service management.

167
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,340
So when you're looking
at one of your processes,

168
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,520
or one of your workloads,
you need to consider

169
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,800
all of these things as
you're laying it out,

170
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,080
so you can make sure you're doing it

171
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,383
the most efficient and
effective way possible.
