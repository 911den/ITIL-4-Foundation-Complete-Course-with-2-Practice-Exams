1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,690
- Service Continuity Management.

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,464
Again, this isn't on the exam,
but it's a good one to know.

3
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:08,230
The purpose of Service
Continuity Management

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,440
is to ensure that the
availability and performance

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,340
of a service is maintained
at a sufficient level

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,280
in the event of a disaster.

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,410
Now, what exactly is the disaster?

8
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,100
Well, it's a sudden,
unplanned event that causes

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,800
great damage or serious
loss to an organization.

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,210
This might be a natural disaster

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,000
like a hurricane or an earthquake.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,830
Or it could be a disaster of a more

13
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,400
modern technological flavor
like a hacker or a data breach.

14
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,080
Either way, if it causes
a sudden, unplanned event

15
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,400
that causes great damage or serious loss,

16
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,200
this would go under your
service continuity management.

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,350
This practice is going to
provide you with a framework

18
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,820
for building your
organization's resiliency

19
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,030
and ensure that you have
the capability of producing

20
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,590
the effective responses
needed to safeguard

21
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,660
the interests of your key stakeholders

22
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,690
and your organizations reputation,

23
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,330
your brand and your value
creating activities.

24
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,310
So, my website, for instance,

25
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,820
we have multiple copies of that server.

26
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,390
We have em backed up, online and offline.

27
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,920
We have redundant servers
and load balancers

28
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,610
so that hopefully, even
if one server goes down,

29
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,180
the other ones can carry the load

30
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,170
and get us through the
disaster until we can

31
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,560
recover the server.

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,220
That's the idea when
you're talking about this

33
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,510
service continuity management.

34
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,710
What things are you
doing to make sure your

35
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,200
availability and your
performance remain up

36
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,979
at a sufficient level so
you're not going to lose time,

37
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,280
money, or value for your customers

38
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,743
whenever there's a disaster.
