1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,640
- Relationship management.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,070
Our next practice is
relationship management.

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,260
And for the exam you do need to understand

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,050
the purpose of relationship management,

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,020
and memorize this definition.

6
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,940
The purpose of relationship management

7
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,730
is to establish and nurture the links

8
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,040
between the organization
and its stakeholders

9
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,360
at strategic and tactical levels.

10
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,920
Now, we do this by identifying, analyzing,

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,130
monitoring, and doing
continual improvement

12
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,230
of those relationships
between various stakeholders.

13
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,810
The most common of these relationships

14
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,540
is the one between the service provider

15
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,210
and the service consumer.

16
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,580
So, in our relationship,

17
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,240
I'm the service provider and
you're the service consumer.

18
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,120
I want to make sure that you're happy.

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,120
I want to make sure
that your needs are met.

20
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,490
And by understanding all of that,

21
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,730
and having a proper
relationship between us,

22
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,460
I'm hoping that you're
going to come and take

23
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,600
more courses from us,

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,577
and that you're going to pass this exam,

25
00:00:48,577 --> 00:00:51,010
and you're going to be happy
and tell all of your friends.

26
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,830
If that happens, then I have some good

27
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:53,700
things that come out of this

28
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,660
relationship management practice.

29
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,740
Now, when we look at
this about stakeholders

30
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,480
at strategic and tactical levels,

31
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,500
it's not just service provider
and service consumer though.

32
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,940
There are a lot of other ones in there.

33
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,780
So, as I'm going through and I'm building

34
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,470
those relationships, I need to
monitor those relationships.

35
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,840
I need to identify the needs
of those relationships.

36
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,260
What exactly does that stakeholder need?

37
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,200
There may be a stakeholder who is asking

38
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,870
for a new product or service.

39
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,050
Well, as part of relationship management,

40
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,650
we're going to talk to them and identify

41
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,230
exactly what all of those
needs are that they have.

42
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,000
We can then put that into our requirements

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,010
and figure our how we're
going to build to those.

44
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,620
As we do that, we're
going to monitor that,

45
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,340
and make sure that we're
meeting all the things

46
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,930
we needed to, and then,

47
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,020
we're going to make sure
that it's done properly,

48
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,430
and we'll go through continual improvement

49
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,270
to make that go through again,

50
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,370
and get it better than it was before.

51
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,900
The whole idea here with
relationship management, again,

52
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,980
is to establish and nurture
the links between the

53
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,650
organization and its various stakeholders

54
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,820
at strategic and tactical levels.

55
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,170
If you remember that for the exam,

56
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,303
you're going to do great.
