00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,840
- In this section of the course,

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,970
we're going to discuss the four dimensions

3
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:05,440
of service management.

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,540
Now as we do this,

5
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,110
this is going to relate to the
describe the four dimensions

6
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,030
of IT Service Management
objective from the exam.

7
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,530
This is considered a
Bloom's level two objective,

8
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,660
which means that we're going
to have to describe it.

9
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,420
We're not going to be memorizing
definitions specifically.

10
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,470
But we need to understand
how this model works,

11
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,610
and how it applies in ITIL.

12
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,580
Now when we talk about the four dimensions

13
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,940
of IT Service Management,

14
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,120
what we're really talking about

15
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,080
is four different perspectives.

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,470
So if I have in the center,

17
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,460
the value that I'm trying to co-create,

18
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,340
I do that by using different products

19
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,830
and services that I deliver
as a service provider

20
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,860
to my consumer or my customer.

21
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,960
Now, the consumer and
customer has this product

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,600
that they want to get value from right?

23
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,433
And that means

24
00:00:45,433 --> 00:00:47,860
we have to deliver that
product or that service.

25
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,790
Now when I go to create
a product or service,

26
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,200
I look at it from four
different perspectives.

27
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,450
And these four perspectives

28
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,250
are what we call the four dimensions

29
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,840
of IT Service Management.

30
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,660
The first one is the
organizations and people.

31
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,120
The second is information and technology.

32
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,270
The third is the partners and suppliers.

33
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:07,150
And the fourth is the value
streams and processes.

34
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,940
And all around that they
have these external factors

35
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,370
you can see around the side
that are going to impact

36
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,720
the service and products
that we're creating as well.

37
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,020
Now we're going to talk about
each of these four areas,

38
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,620
and those external factors

39
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,420
throughout the rest of this section.
