1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,200
- What is value?

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,440
Well in ITL 4, value is
the perceived benefits,

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,700
usefulness, and importance of something.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,360
Now I know this is very generic.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,540
But let's dig into the short
definition and explore it a bit

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,970
because value is an
extremely important concept

7
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,110
inside of ITIL and service
management in general.

8
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,530
First, notice in the definition
that value is perceived.

9
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,180
This means that the amount of value

10
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,890
something has is always subjective.

11
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,720
Who gets to determine this
perceived amount of value?

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,310
Well the privilege is reserved

13
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,030
for the recipient of the value.

14
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,570
So let me give you an
example to help clarify it.

15
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,150
There's two roommates, Julia and John.

16
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,800
One afternoon, they both decide

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,580
they want to go get an orange.

18
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,170
They walk over to the refrigerator

19
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,500
to each get themself an orange

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,560
and find that there's only
one left in the fruit drawer.

21
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,780
They begin to fight with each other

22
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,000
because each person really wants
that orange for themselves.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,330
Julia says she values the orange more

24
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,600
and she should have it.

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,500
But John quickly retorts that
he values the orange more

26
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,090
and that he should have it.

27
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,500
Neither person explains to the other

28
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,780
why they want the orange.

29
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,680
Instead they don't tell
them about the value

30
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,380
they perceive that it has.

31
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,190
But being omniscient as the
narrator in this example,

32
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,590
I know exactly what each of them

33
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,140
wants to do with that orange.

34
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,140
Julia's hungry and she desired to have

35
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,080
a sweet and healthy afternoon snack.

36
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,980
So if she gets the orange,
she plans to cut it apart,

37
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,040
eat the sweet, juicy flesh inside of it,

38
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,560
and throw away the peel.

39
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,440
Now in her perceived value of this orange,

40
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,070
the inside of the orange
holds 100% of the value

41
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,930
and the peel is garbage, it's worthless.

42
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,190
John on the other hand, he's a baker,

43
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,090
and this afternoon he wanted
to make some orange cupcakes.

44
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,720
So he needed the orange peel

45
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,440
to be able to zest it into the batter.

46
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,380
If he gets the orange, he
intends to simply use the peel

47
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,540
and throw away the orange and
sweet inside into the trash.

48
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,490
Unlike Julia who places
100% of the orange's value

49
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,040
on it's ability to be eaten
as an afternoon snack,

50
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,850
John believes that that part of the orange

51
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,400
is completely worthless.

52
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,330
Instead, he places 100% of the
value into the orange peel.

53
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,770
Now I'm sure you can see the

54
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,610
interesting thing here about value.

55
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,570
This one orange could
serve 100% of the needs

56
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,840
for each person involved
in this transaction.

57
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,220
If only they could communicate

58
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,400
their true desires for that orange.

59
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,200
They could both have 100% of the value

60
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,670
because the value is perceived
by the end recipient.

61
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,620
And in this case, our two roommates

62
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,110
each view it differently.

63
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,300
Now to the grocer who was

64
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,900
the original supplier of this orange,

65
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,410
he sold that orange for a single dollar.

66
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,760
Had he'd known that they
both value that $1 orange

67
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,560
for different reasons, maybe he would have

68
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,900
cut the orange apart, separate the insides

69
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,180
away from the peel and sold
each portion for a dollar each.

70
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,690
And if he done that to
each of the roommates,

71
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,090
he would have doubled the
orange's value for himself.

72
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,730
Now I know that sounds a little crazy,

73
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,500
but I bet on exam day you're going to

74
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,700
remember about this orange and value.

75
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,670
You're going to remember
that the amount of value

76
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,140
that something has is based on

77
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,100
the recipient's perception
of that value right?

78
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,460
It's the recipient that actually is

79
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,680
expected to get the
value from the products,

80
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,860
from those relationships,
from those services,

81
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,910
from whatever it is we're
expecting to deliver,

82
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,030
or to facilitate the value for them.

83
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,870
Because of this, value is
always considered subjective.

84
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,070
And it can be quite different

85
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,170
from what the original
supplier planned for.

86
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,570
It may be different from what they

87
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,930
had described the product as

88
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,540
or what service it was going to fulfill,

89
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,890
and from what we originally agreed to.

90
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,300
This subjectivity should be captured,

91
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,090
measured, and evaluated because

92
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,450
this is what we have to
work with as an organization

93
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,430
that performs service management.

94
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,320
Now let's get back to our
definition of value once more.

95
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,600
Value is the perceived benefits,

96
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,030
usefulness, and importance of something.

97
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,810
As I said before this definition
is a bit generic right.

98
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,120
This is because it uses this
vague term of something.

99
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,120
This word was specifically
chosen by the creator's of ITIL

100
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,670
because service management goes beyond

101
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,410
just services these days.

102
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,270
Because the perceived benefits
and usefulness of something

103
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,100
really do depend on the context

104
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,550
that it's being talked about.

105
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,740
In each given context, we
know what that something is.

106
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,090
And we know what it means
in the value definition.

107
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,940
But in a generic definition like this,

108
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,330
we can't simply list all of
the things something could be.

109
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,400
So something becomes that placeholder.

110
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,920
Because when we talk about value,

111
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,620
value is really based on
these relationships as well.

112
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,660
And we're going to discuss those

113
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,883
service relationships in a future lesson.
