1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,550
- What is the vision?

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,580
Each improvement initiative should support

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,120
the organization's goals and objectives.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,270
The first step of the
continual improvement model

5
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,570
is to define the vision of the initiative.

6
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,230
What exactly are we trying to accomplish?

7
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,820
This is going to provide the context

8
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,610
for all of our subsequent decisions,

9
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,640
and links all of our individual actions

10
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,300
to the organization's
vision for the future.

11
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,310
This vision is going to come
from your top leadership.

12
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,920
It should come from the C-suite;

13
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,720
the CEO, the CFO, the CIO, or others

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,620
who have this executive vision
of where we're trying to go

15
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,350
with the organization.

16
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,530
This step of the continual
improvement model

17
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,750
focuses on two key areas.

18
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,720
First, the organization's
vision and objectives

19
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,640
that need to be translated
for specific business units,

20
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,950
departments, teams, and individuals.

21
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,580
So we take this context

22
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,690
and we take it from
the larger organization

23
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,480
and drill it down into our specific cases

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,210
that we're doing our
improvement initiative inside.

25
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,760
If we don't do that, it
can be really difficult

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,770
for us to know how we're
going towards the right way.

27
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,430
The second thing is you need
to have a high-level vision

28
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,120
for the planned improvement,
and this has to be created.

29
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,950
Somebody has to write it, and
someone has to agree to it.

30
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,190
Normally, this will be
your department head

31
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,110
or upper leadership, if it's going to be

32
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,860
an organization-wide
improvement initiative.

33
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,290
Now, you may be wondering

34
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,870
why is this step of determining
your vision so important?

35
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,740
Well, if we neglect to do this,

36
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,540
we may see some incremental improvements

37
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,640
in some areas or some teams,
but we're not going to see

38
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,160
a holistic improvement across
the organization as a whole.

39
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,020
If you want big improvements,
you need to have a big vision.

40
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,360
Now, the other problem is that

41
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,460
sometimes these improvements
that we're working on

42
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,660
don't actually help to
advance the overall vision

43
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,660
of the company.

44
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,130
Instead, we might be spending
time and money and resources

45
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,690
and energy working on some
non-value-adding activities,

46
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:53,220
all because we didn't know
what the true vision was,

47
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,300
and all of those resources,
they could've been

48
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,620
invested much better in other improvements

49
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,840
if only we knew what the vision was.

50
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,410
So, by the time you're done

51
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,600
with the "what is the
vision step" of the model,

52
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,850
you should ensure that you know

53
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,400
what the high-level direction is

54
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,490
and that it's fully understood.

55
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,130
You need to make sure that you also have

56
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,180
the planned improvement
initiatives described

57
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,120
and understand the context of
them inside your organization.

58
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,270
Additionally, all of your
stakeholders need to be identified

59
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,540
and their roles have
to be well-understood.

60
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,340
The role of the person or the team

61
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,470
that's responsible for
carrying out this improvement

62
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,280
is also now going to be clear to you,

63
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,980
and you're going to understand their role

64
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,390
in relation to achieving the
overall organization's vision.

65
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,590
And, the expected value from this vision

66
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,180
should also be agreed upon.

67
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,950
That way, we all know
what we're getting into.

68
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,170
Basically, by understanding your vision,

69
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,560
we now know what direction
we should be moving towards

70
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,150
with all of our improvements,

71
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,800
who we're going to be helping with
it and who's going to help us,

72
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,713
and how it's going to effect
the organization as a whole.
