1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
- So now that we've
covered all four dimensions

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,440
and the external factors
throughout this section,

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,010
I want to put it all together
in a real world example,

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,370
to really drive the point home

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,992
of how these all work together.

6
00:00:10,992 --> 00:00:13,180
So we talked about our four dimensions,

7
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,233
organizations and people,

8
00:00:14,233 --> 00:00:16,180
information and technology,

9
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,240
partners and suppliers,

10
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,990
and value streams and processes.

11
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,850
As well as those six external
factors that all are focused

12
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,130
in how we look at our
products and services.

13
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,820
To co create value with our consumers.

14
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,480
Well let's consider the
process of incident management.

15
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,780
How are we going to deal
with incident management

16
00:00:35,348 --> 00:00:36,430
when something happens to
our service or our product?

17
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,320
Well, if we look at it
through the organizations

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,480
and people lens or that dimension,

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,510
we're going to ask the question of

20
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,270
how we're going to organize our teams?

21
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,310
Is this something the service
desk is going to handle?

22
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,850
Are we going to have different tiers?

23
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,490
Like Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 support?

24
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,215
Or are we going to have
a flat organization?

25
00:00:51,215 --> 00:00:52,527
These are all things
we have to figure out.

26
00:00:52,527 --> 00:00:55,630
How're we going to organize
our communications?

27
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,230
How is that Tier 1
representative going to transfer

28
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,809
the information they collected
to the Tier 2 representative

29
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:03,627
if you're going to use a tiered
or vertical organization?

30
00:01:03,627 --> 00:01:05,860
How're you going to escalate
it up to the next level?

31
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,108
At which trip points?

32
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,600
How about the people you need?

33
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,110
How're you going to decide how
many people you need to run

34
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,440
the incident management
for a particular service?

35
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,764
What competencies do they need?

36
00:01:14,764 --> 00:01:17,530
Is this service going to
be something that uses AWS,

37
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,460
do you need Amazon Web
Service certified people?

38
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,630
Or is this going to be something

39
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,840
that we're goin to use local services?

40
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,140
How about the qualifications?

41
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,349
How about the way they're
going to interact?

42
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:28,170
How are you going to motivate the people?

43
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,370
How are you goin to hire the right people?

44
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,870
How are you goin to keep the right people?

45
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,280
How are you goin to pay them?

46
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,080
And how are you going to make
sure that they're capable

47
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,660
of doing the incident management
that you want them to do?

48
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,240
All of these are things you
have to think about from

49
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,080
the organizations and people lens

50
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,643
or perspective or dimension.

51
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,800
Now when I look at from the
information and technology side,

52
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,130
let's think about it from
the process stand point.

53
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,970
How am I going to register the incident?

54
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,363
Am I writing it down on a piece of paper?

55
00:01:50,363 --> 00:01:52,315
Am I putting it in a internet portal?

56
00:01:52,315 --> 00:01:55,000
Am I using a certain piece of software

57
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,520
or hardware to do that?

58
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,490
How about the relationship
between incidents.

59
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,790
How do I know that this
incident with this printer,

60
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,623
that happened today,

61
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:03,740
is related or not related to the one

62
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,037
that happened three weeks ago?

63
00:02:05,037 --> 00:02:07,160
Well maybe I have some kind of technology

64
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,590
or information management
software that does that for me.

65
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,750
That contract the
incidents in the problems.

66
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,130
Or the incidents and the
particular configuration item,

67
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,410
meaning that printer.

68
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,250
Or the incidents and the different users

69
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,360
who were being affected.

70
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,520
Maybe when we get all of these calls

71
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,480
and we put them together,

72
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,210
we find that all of the users affected,

73
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,370
always added Building 1
and not in Building 2.

74
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,470
So maybe it's a problems with Building 1.

75
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,270
And so we can look into that, right?

76
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,710
How about incident management
tools for information flow.

77
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,470
How're we going to do work flow?

78
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,240
How're we going to use knowledge bases?

79
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,620
How about diagnostic tools.

80
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,120
How're we going to detect these events,

81
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,147
and process these events?

82
00:02:39,147 --> 00:02:41,150
How're we going to
communicate with each other?

83
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,038
How're we going to
organize and share data?

84
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,000
All of this is stuff that goes under

85
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,290
that information part of the information

86
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,882
and technology portion of this dimension.

87
00:02:49,882 --> 00:02:51,527
Then we get to our third dimension.

88
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:54,664
And we start looking at our
partners and suppliers, right?

89
00:02:54,664 --> 00:02:56,690
Because nobody is self sufficient,

90
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,170
we talked about this before.

91
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,700
Maybe this printer is broken
because it ran out of supplies,

92
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,220
there's no more paper,
there's no more toner, right?

93
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,260
So those are things that
we have to think about.

94
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,603
We think about partners and suppliers,

95
00:03:07,603 --> 00:03:09,660
we have to think about the external teams

96
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,670
that are going to contribute
to the success of our service.

97
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,173
Maybe in this case, we
have outsourced completely

98
00:03:15,173 --> 00:03:16,950
the management of the printers,

99
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,570
and that company isn't doing a good job.

100
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,770
And so we need to evaluate their contract.

101
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:21,887
If we outsource a service,

102
00:03:21,887 --> 00:03:24,380
how're we going to
escalate incidents to them

103
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,830
once something is broken?

104
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,510
Or maybe we escalate top tier service.

105
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,972
So we handle minor incidents in house,

106
00:03:30,972 --> 00:03:34,020
but we're going to outsource
those major incidents

107
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,880
and so we have to escalate it to them.

108
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,530
How do we get information back from them

109
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,840
when they fix something, right?

110
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,470
Two way street between
partners and suppliers and us.

111
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,487
All of this is things
we have to think about

112
00:03:43,487 --> 00:03:45,400
and we start considering
how're we going to operate

113
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,070
with our partners and suppliers, right?

114
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,470
And then we have our final
dimension to look at.

115
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,040
Which is going to be our value
streams and our processes.

116
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,760
Maybe we look at that value stream

117
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,270
and see that this whole
process of printing,

118
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,850
actually has issues with it,

119
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,860
because it's not optimized properly.

120
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,470
There's too much waste in it.

121
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,690
Maybe we've looked at it
and we said " Y'know what,

122
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,580
we can take out step number two

123
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,820
and just make it step
one and three and four

124
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,430
and that will solve the problem."

125
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,100
All of those things are things
that we would've evaluate

126
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,600
as we look at it from the four dimensions.

127
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,340
And then finally, we
might want to look at it

128
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,290
from those external perspectives.

129
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,123
One of those,

130
00:04:18,123 --> 00:04:18,956
the E,

131
00:04:18,956 --> 00:04:20,430
stood for environmental.

132
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,620
Maybe we have somebody
who doesn't like the fact

133
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,790
that we're printing and
wasting a bunch of trees

134
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,490
by printing out a lot of stuff.

135
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,490
And so somebody might've
jammed the printer on purpose

136
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,168
to break it, because they are
an environmentalist, right?

137
00:04:31,168 --> 00:04:33,840
That's kind of crazy, but
you kind of get the idea

138
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,800
of what I'm talking about.

139
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,450
We can start thinking about
all of these four dimensions

140
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,980
and these external factors and
how they're going to effect

141
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,370
a simple service,

142
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,900
something like printing or something like

143
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,020
an incident management.

144
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,230
And as we look at this,

145
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,650
that's how all of this
ends up tying together.

146
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,300
And that's the whole idea of
using these four dimensions.

147
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,530
When you're thinking about your processes,

148
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,100
your people, your
organization, your technology,

149
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,400
your information, all of that stuff,

150
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,850
so you can make sure that
your products and services

151
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,263
are delivering the value
that they are suppose to.
