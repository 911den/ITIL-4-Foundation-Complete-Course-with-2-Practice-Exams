1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,190
- Think and work holistically.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,830
This is our fifth guiding principle.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,350
This principle says that we
should take a holistic approach

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,390
to service management and this requires us

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,440
to have an understanding
of all of the parts

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,700
of the organization and
how they work together

7
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,410
in an integrated way.

8
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,630
Think about this like your car.

9
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,170
Your car, you get in and you drive,

10
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,270
and your output of that or outcome of that

11
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,530
is that it gets you
from point a to point b,

12
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,560
but that car is a complex
piece of machinery.

13
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,300
There are lots of different systems,

14
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,980
from the engines to the
brakes to the transmissions,

15
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:32,860
to the air conditioning.

16
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,520
They all have to work together

17
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,660
to make that system work.

18
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,770
Now if you understand it from end to end,

19
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,960
that's understanding it holistically.

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,900
You have to understand everything
and how it works together.

21
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,070
Now as somebody who drives a car,

22
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,950
do I really need to know every
single piece of that car?

23
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,120
No, I need to know the
holistic approach to it

24
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,170
and that way I can
understand its simplicity,

25
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,380
of if I put the key in and I turn it,

26
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,600
that's going to turn on the engine

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,020
and allow me to drive to my destination.

28
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,370
Now as we look at our IT services
and IT service management,

29
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,950
we have to make sure that we're addressing

30
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,310
all four dimensions

31
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,940
because this will make
sure that we're thinking

32
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,910
of things in a holistic manner.

33
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,190
I'm going to consider my
organizations and people,

34
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,830
the information and technology,

35
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,260
the partners and suppliers,

36
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,370
and the values streams and processes.

37
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,290
If I use those four dimensions
of IT service management,

38
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,770
those four perspectives,

39
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,570
I'm going to make sure that I
have a good holistic overview

40
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,490
of how that service works

41
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,090
and then if I want to get a
little more tactical with it,

42
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,440
I can go ahead and look at
the service value system

43
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,980
for that particular service.

44
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,870
I'm going to look at the input,
the demand and the opportunity,

45
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:38,770
as it goes through the middle
of the service value chain

46
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,070
and it goes through the governance

47
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,180
and the continual improvement

48
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,370
and the guiding principles

49
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,720
and then out the other side,

50
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,270
as the desired outcome or value.

51
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,450
Again, by using these two frameworks,

52
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,310
the four dimensions and
that service value system,

53
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,770
I really can understand things

54
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,980
in a much more holistic way.

55
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,480
Now as I look at things
from a holistic area,

56
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,200
I want you to remember
that systems are complex

57
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,890
and you have to recognize that
these systems are complex.

58
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,330
There's a lot of inputs and
there's a lot of outputs.

59
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,640
Things are rarely as simple
as steps one, two, and three.

60
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,810
Generally, there are
steps one, two, and three,

61
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,730
but they're impacted by another series

62
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,830
of processes or steps that
are outside of itself.

63
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,860
If I'm running something
like a web server,

64
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,560
well I'm going to have the
website and the code for that

65
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,970
but it also has an
underlying operating system

66
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,500
and an underlying server
and an underlying network,

67
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,940
an underlying connectivity

68
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,960
and all of those are interrelated.

69
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,130
If I understand the
complexity of the system,

70
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,430
I can then understand the
simplicity of the system

71
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,610
on the other side of it

72
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,360
and I'll explain that in a
little bit here, as well.

73
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,440
Another key to working
holistically is to collaborate.

74
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,780
And we talked about collaboration

75
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,550
in the fourth guiding principle.

76
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,520
Collaboration really
is the key to thinking

77
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,990
and working holistically.

78
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,950
If I work in IT, I might
understand all the bits

79
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,920
and the bytes and the
servers and the connectivity.

80
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,790
But I might not understand
what the larger business

81
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,110
is looking for to get out of this service.

82
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,640
So as I look at this service,

83
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,060
I want to make sure I'm collaborating

84
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,930
with the people who are going
to be selling the service,

85
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,650
the people who are going to
be marketing the service,

86
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,520
the people who are going to
be supporting the service,

87
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,880
and if we all look at it

88
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,640
from all our different perspectives,

89
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,370
we can make sure we're
looking at this thing

90
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,850
in a holistic and integrated way.

91
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,870
Whenever possible, we want to
look for patterns of interaction

92
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,640
between our different system elements.

93
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,580
What are the things that are
going to get inputs or outputs

94
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,320
from this system and
affect the way it performs.

95
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,310
To make something truly simple,

96
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,020
you have to understand
all of its complexity

97
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,210
and then once you
understand the complexity,

98
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,250
you can proceed to bringing it back up

99
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,360
to a simple representation.

100
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,070
For example, recently I was
working with an organization

101
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,840
and we were trying to better understand

102
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,420
the way their cyber
security posture was set up.

103
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,030
Their cyber security posture had dozens

104
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,000
and dozens of different systems.

105
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,040
All working together
to hopefully give them

106
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,960
a good cyber security posture.

107
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,580
Now as we wanted to figure
out what the complexity was

108
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,770
and to simplify it,

109
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,410
we had to go through and bring in people

110
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,330
from all of the different programs

111
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,960
that were being run
across the security stack

112
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,650
and as we did that, we
started figuring out

113
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,280
okay, this program does
functions one, two, and three.

114
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,520
This other one does
functions four and five.

115
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,470
This other program does functions
one, four, five, and six.

116
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,450
And we had to start laying
out in deep complexity,

117
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,560
each of the interactions

118
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,390
between all of these different systems,

119
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,650
so we can then look simply as we step back

120
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,190
and say okay we are fully
covering this service

121
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,850
from a security perspective holistically.

122
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,080
Again, if you want to
make something simple,

123
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,730
you have to first understand
the complexity of it.

124
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,090
Then you can go through
and try to minimize

125
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,280
as much of the complexity

126
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,600
and represent it as a
simple solution at the end.

127
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,710
Finally when you're working holistically,

128
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,370
you also may want to consider
the use of automation

129
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,830
because automation can
help us to facilitate

130
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,570
working holistically across our staff.

131
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,700
If we consider the example

132
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,450
of an incident management system,

133
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,350
your service desk is probably
going to be the entry point

134
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,170
for any incidents that are
reported to the organization.

135
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,630
They're your first line help desk

136
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,580
and ask people call in
with their problems,

137
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,880
they're going to log those,
categorize those, and tag those.

138
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,710
But at that point, the system
can then use automation

139
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,050
to make sure those get put
into the right department

140
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,720
for them to be able to work it.

141
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,260
For example, if you had a
a hard drive that failed,

142
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,650
you're going to call the help desk,

143
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,930
they're going to put in the ticket

144
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:14,990
and it's going to get routed over

145
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,660
to people who support hardware.

146
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,760
If you're having trouble
accessing a certain website,

147
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,550
that might get routed to a different team

148
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,383
and it's going to be working

149
00:05:21,383 --> 00:05:23,550
across the entire organization that way

150
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,360
but this IT service, this
service of incident management

151
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,310
is going to be something
that's going to be holistic

152
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,680
across the staff

153
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,280
and we're going to use
automation to help support that.
