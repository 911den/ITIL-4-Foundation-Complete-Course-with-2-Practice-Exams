1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,890
- At this point in the course,

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,480
we've already mentioned
the word risk a few times,

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,680
but I wanted to dive into it

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,090
in a little bit more
detail in this lesson.

5
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,500
Risk refers to a possible
event that could cause

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,250
harm, loss, or make it more difficult

7
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,880
to achieve your objectives.

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,650
Essentially, it's any possible
event that could impact

9
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,643
our ability to co-create that
value through our services.

10
00:00:20,643 --> 00:00:22,830
Generally, when most people think of risk

11
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,570
and service management,
they think about it

12
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,970
from a new insallation
or a project perspective.

13
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,744
But risk is also present in
the form of our services too.

14
00:00:29,744 --> 00:00:32,850
From a service provider
perspective, our goal is to

15
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,552
minimize risk for our
customers who use our services.

16
00:00:35,552 --> 00:00:38,870
In this way, risks are similar to costs.

17
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,340
But just like costs, our
customers will assume

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,021
that some new risk is going to occur

19
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:46,130
as part of their
consumption of our services.

20
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,640
For example, if we go
back to my Uber example

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,070
where I was a customer using the app

22
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,661
to get rides all over San Francisco,

23
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:54,510
I removed the risk of not
finding a parking space

24
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,411
for my rental car since
the service removed my need

25
00:00:56,411 --> 00:00:59,170
for me to have my own rental
car in the first place.

26
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,630
However, I now run the
risk of not being able

27
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,940
to call an Uber if the app malfunctions.

28
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,410
Or, what if I'm in an area where

29
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,120
there's no cellular service?

30
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,811
Or, what if my phone battery dies?

31
00:01:08,811 --> 00:01:11,690
All of these are new
risks that are introduced

32
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:15,070
into my desired outcome of
traveling around San Francisco.

33
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,930
Now as a consumer of the
service, I can also contribute

34
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,180
to reducing the risk by taking
some mitigating actions.

35
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,830
For example, I can carry around

36
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,480
a spare battery pack with me.

37
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,312
By doing this as a consumer, I am reducing

38
00:01:26,312 --> 00:01:28,280
the risk that I won't be
able to call for an Uber

39
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,830
when I need one because
of my battery dying.

40
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,691
At the same time, I might also communicate

41
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:34,358
to Uber that I'm finding it difficult

42
00:01:34,358 --> 00:01:37,180
to use their service in more rural areas.

43
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,700
Maybe when I'm outside the city,

44
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,930
I'm not getting enough
Uber drivers in that area.

45
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,600
By more clearly articulating
my needs and my requirements,

46
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,640
then the service provider can determine

47
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,550
if they're able to better meet them.

48
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,820
Maybe Uber is going to decide that
they're going to pay a premium

49
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,760
or a bonus to their drivers who will work

50
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,700
in those more rural areas
outside the city center.

51
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,920
That might increase the number
of drivers on those streets

52
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,380
and make it easier for
customers to get a ride.

53
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,270
Now as a consumer, it's up to me to

54
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,820
clearly communicate my needs
to that service provider

55
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,639
and to clarify the outcomes
that I want to achieve.

56
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:09,410
I also need to make sure I'm
communicating any constraints

57
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,600
or critical success factors

58
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,380
that I may have for that service.

59
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,930
This means I'm putting requirements

60
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,570
on that service provider, right?

61
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,880
Well, guess what?

62
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,270
This service provider may also

63
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,220
put requirements on me as a customer too.

64
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,290
In the example of Uber, they require me

65
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,450
to have a cell phone, a valid data plan,

66
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:28,511
and the ability to send my
GPS location to their drivers

67
00:02:28,511 --> 00:02:31,391
by using the location
tracking feature on my phone.

68
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:33,511
This is a two way street after all.

69
00:02:33,511 --> 00:02:35,560
We're both working to co-create

70
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,711
the value and reduce the overall risk.

71
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:41,290
Now, since risk is a possible
event that could cause harm

72
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,959
or make it more difficult for
us to achieve our objectives,

73
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:47,031
we can do some things
to mitigate that risk.

74
00:02:47,031 --> 00:02:49,020
Well, what are those
things that we can do?

75
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,690
There's actually 4 things
we can do with risk.

76
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,810
We can avoid risk, we can accept risk,

77
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,140
we can transfer risk,
or we can mitigate risk.

78
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,210
Now, when we avoid risk, we're aiming

79
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,840
to actually remove it
completely from the service.

80
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,010
Now, in reality, we can't remove
all the risk for a service

81
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,910
because risk is something
that's inherent in everything

82
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,830
that a business does to
some level in some degree.

83
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,510
But, there are certain risks
that we can avoid completely.

84
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,130
For example, let's say that
you're running a service

85
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,260
that allows people to read your blog.

86
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,640
Maybe you're worried about
the new privacy regulations

87
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,430
and don't want to have to
worry about maintaining

88
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,297
all of the blog reader's
information securely

89
00:03:24,297 --> 00:03:27,577
and properly under the
new GDPR provisions.

90
00:03:27,577 --> 00:03:30,050
Well, you could avoid
those issues completely

91
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,430
if you turn off tracking on
your reader's information

92
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,800
by disabling any cookies,
and you can also remove any

93
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,340
requests for their email addresses

94
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,720
and other things like that.

95
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,545
If you're not collecting their
information, you no longer

96
00:03:39,545 --> 00:03:41,464
have to protect that information.

97
00:03:41,464 --> 00:03:43,944
Now, this may not be the
best business decision, right

98
00:03:43,944 --> 00:03:46,224
because most businesses
want to be able to track

99
00:03:46,224 --> 00:03:48,894
their customers and contact
them by email with offers.

100
00:03:48,894 --> 00:03:51,385
So, while you can avoid
this whole situation,

101
00:03:51,385 --> 00:03:53,080
it's probably better if we found

102
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,120
a better way to handle this risk.

103
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,610
And that brings us to
simply accepting the risk.

104
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,593
With this option, you look
at the cost of protecting

105
00:03:59,593 --> 00:04:02,414
against the risk and you look
at the possible bad outcomes

106
00:04:02,414 --> 00:04:04,494
and determine that it's
simply cheaper to pay

107
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,513
to accept the risk and pay up
if you're going to get caught.

108
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:10,384
Now, going back to our privacy
example, I have a friend

109
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:12,610
who is in an Australian based company,

110
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,504
which is outside of the European Union.

111
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,170
Because of this, he's
taken the position that

112
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,020
he's not worried about
complying with the GDPR policies

113
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,820
because he's an Australian
living in Australia

114
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,670
and he has an Australian company.

115
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,030
He isn't actively targeting
European customers,

116
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,454
but if they happen to
go to his site, too bad.

117
00:04:29,454 --> 00:04:32,060
He's calculated the risk
and he believes the risk

118
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,184
is low that the EU is
going to try to fine him

119
00:04:34,184 --> 00:04:35,890
or even collect if they do.

120
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,660
So he's taken no actions in regard

121
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,370
to changing the way his website works

122
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,800
or the way his business works.

123
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,820
He's going to do it the exact
same way he did before GDPR

124
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,970
to the way it is after GDPR.

125
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,770
Now, this is called risk acceptance.

126
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,730
Now, the next thing we could do is we can

127
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,190
instead decide to transfer the risk.

128
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,330
Maybe you don't want to be
responsible for collecting

129
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,036
and storing all this private information,

130
00:04:57,036 --> 00:04:58,944
but you still want access to that data.

131
00:04:58,944 --> 00:05:00,880
Well, in that case you can hire

132
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,890
a service provider to collect it for you,

133
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,430
to store it securely,
and to give you access.

134
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,770
This would be a form of risk transfer.

135
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,740
Another option might be
that you take the approach

136
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,900
that my Australian friend
did and he simply is going to

137
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,850
pay some insurance in case
you get sued or fined.

138
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,170
This transfers the risk
to the insurance company

139
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,930
because you paid them a monthly premium

140
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,705
to take that risk on for you.

141
00:05:20,705 --> 00:05:24,110
Our final option with risk
is what's most commonly used.

142
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,290
It's known as risk mitigation.

143
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,020
With risk mitigation, we
put in place some actions to

144
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,570
reduce the risk even if it
doesn't eliminate it completely.

145
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,800
In our privacy data example, we may add

146
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,060
new technology systems that
are going to better protect

147
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,990
the data and implement new processes

148
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,620
in the way that we handle the data.

149
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,370
This will help us reduce the risk and

150
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,790
hopefully make the
information much more secure,

151
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,420
which is one of the intended
outcomes of GDPR anyway.

152
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,880
But, a hacker can still
break into our network

153
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,870
and steal all of the customers' data.

154
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,620
If this happens, we might
have reduced the risk

155
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,710
but we didn't eliminate the risk.

156
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,683
That's the idea of risk mitigation.
