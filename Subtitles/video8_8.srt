00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:02,300
- Knowledge Management.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,160
This is another one that is not covered

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,970
by the ITIL 4 exam, but it's
one that we're going to cover

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,410
briefly to give you a general awareness.

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,630
Knowledge management
is focused on providing

6
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,910
and understanding of all
of the different elements

7
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,520
that make up an organization
and how those elements

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,070
relate to one another.

9
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,010
So when I think about
knowledge management,

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm thinking about
collecting all of the data

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,320
and everything that's
inside the organization.

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,560
In fact, when we talk
about knowledge management,

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,530
there are four things that we look at.

14
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,560
We have the baseline of data,

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,170
and then built from
data, we get information.

16
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,190
When we get more information,
we can consolidate

17
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,430
it together in context to get knowledge,

18
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,500
and then from knowledge,
we can get to the top thing

19
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,030
we want, which is wisdom, where
we can make good decisions.

20
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,100
Now, let me give you a
good example of this.

21
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,030
Let me give you a piece of data, 90.

22
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,860
By itself, 90 doesn't
mean much to you, does it?

23
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,500
But if I give you that data
with a little bit of context,

24
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,980
it can become information.

25
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,960
For example, I could say 90 degrees.

26
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,010
Now, you know that it's a temperature.

27
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,600
And maybe I told you that
it's 90 degrees outside.

28
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,360
Now you know it's the weather temperature

29
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,060
for the outside area we're in.

30
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,030
Now if I take that
information and I combine it

31
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,410
with some other information,
I might be able to get

32
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,590
knowledge out of this.

33
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,070
90 degrees is a hot temperature outside.

34
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,980
I may decide now that
I want to wear shorts

35
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,520
and a t-shirt instead of
long pants and a jacket

36
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,150
because 90 degrees is pretty hot.

37
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,520
Now, if I take a bunch
of knowledge together,

38
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,170
I can combine it to get
wisdom, and this will allow me

39
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,310
to make forward looking decisions.

40
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,340
For example, because
it's 90 degrees outside,

41
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,550
there may become a larger number of users

42
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,660
who decide to skip work
today and go to the beach.

43
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,310
Knowing that we're a company who provides

44
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,740
wireless service around
the beaches as well,

45
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,200
we better be prepared to increase

46
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,050
the available bandwidth and be prepared

47
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,380
for additional phone
calls from mobile users

48
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,070
because they're going to
be out on their phones

49
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,180
instead of on their desktops today.

50
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,320
You can see how we could
take this information from

51
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,520
data into information,
information into knowledge,

52
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,370
and knowledge into wisdom.

53
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,540
Knowledge management is a huge field.

54
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,890
In fact, there are entire
people whose full time job it is

55
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,990
to figure out how we're going to take data

56
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,420
and turn it into information,
information into knowledge,

57
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,093
and knowledge into wisdom.
