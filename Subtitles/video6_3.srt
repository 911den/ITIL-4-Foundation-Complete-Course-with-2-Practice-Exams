1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,171
- Improve.

2
00:00:01,171 --> 00:00:04,032
The next value chain activity
I want to focus on is

3
00:00:04,032 --> 00:00:06,690
the improve value chain activity.

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,080
The purpose of the Improve
value chain activity

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,050
is to ensure continual improvement of our

6
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:12,956
products, services, and practices

7
00:00:12,956 --> 00:00:15,760
across all of our value chain activities

8
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,680
and the four dimensions
of IT service management.

9
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,240
We take a lot of different
inputs into the improve activity.

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,310
We're going to be looking at things

11
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,710
like product and service
improvement information

12
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,950
that we get back from deliver and support.

13
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,490
As we talk about deliver and support,

14
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,480
these are your operations personnel.

15
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,600
They're the ones who are
running the service desk,

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,760
and running all the
servers and the services.

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,530
So they're constantly getting
feedback from your end-users,

18
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,950
from your consumers,
and from your customers.

19
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,100
We also want to take
stakeholders' feedback in

20
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,602
from the engage process.

21
00:00:44,602 --> 00:00:47,420
As we look at that, that
might be things between

22
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,030
us and our suppliers,
or us and our partners,

23
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,710
or us and our consumers.

24
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,144
All of that is information
that's coming back in

25
00:00:53,144 --> 00:00:55,460
through engage and engage
is going to take that

26
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,640
and pass it over to the improve activity

27
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,210
so improvements can be made
based on that feedback.

28
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,070
We also will look at the

29
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,590
performance information and
improvement opportunities

30
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,690
that are provided from all of

31
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,420
the different value chain activities.

32
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,310
As we're measuring things
across the lifecycle,

33
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,800
and across all of our
processes and activities,

34
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,440
we want to make sure that's
being fed back to improvement

35
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,290
so we can figure out how can we do things

36
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,380
better, cheaper, faster, more efficient,

37
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,720
whatever the case may be.

38
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,110
We're always trying to improve

39
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,740
to get more value for less cost.

40
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,470
And then, we also want
to look at all of the

41
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,950
knowledge and information about our

42
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,820
new and changed products and services

43
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,410
from design and transition
and obtain/build.

44
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:33,930
So as we're going through and building

45
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,800
a new server, or new service,

46
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,690
we want to get that information
and pass it back to improve

47
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:41,090
because then, improve
can look at it and make

48
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,750
suggestions and recommendations
of how to do this

49
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,260
better, cheaper, faster, etc., right?

50
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,510
We also are going to look at all the

51
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,970
knowledge and information about our

52
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,410
third-party service components
from the engage perspective.

53
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,960
So, the improvement is also then

54
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,370
getting information from engage

55
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,590
from our partners and our supplies.

56
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,220
Because maybe our supplier's moving

57
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,180
from a self-hosted environment
into a cloud environment

58
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,960
and that new information
can factor into our planning

59
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,750
for improvements in the future.

60
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,070
Well, we start talking about outputs

61
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,431
from the improve process, this
is going to be things like

62
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:13,700
improvement initiatives and plans

63
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,330
for all of the other
value chain activities.

64
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,190
The improve is looking across the

65
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:22,690
entire service value chain
and service value system.

66
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,857
And as they look at that,
they're going to figure out,

67
00:02:24,857 --> 00:02:27,272
"Hey, build and obtain,
you guys could have

68
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:30,750
done this for half of the
price if you had done thing X."

69
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,110
And they'll make that
recommendation or that plan

70
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,780
of how to do it better next time.

71
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,580
We're also going to have value
chain performance information

72
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,210
from plan and from the governing body.

73
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,550
As we get that information,

74
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,350
we're going to be able to pass
that back out to those folks

75
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,790
and make sure that we can use that

76
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,640
improve information out across the field.

77
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,650
Also, we're going to be looking
at our improve status reports

78
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,600
for all the value chain activities.

79
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,890
As we've taken all this
information in from everybody

80
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,860
and we figure out how
we're going to improve it,

81
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,830
we're going to put those
status reports back out

82
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,700
and say, "Here are the recommendations,

83
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,480
and here's how you can improve things."

84
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,850
Again, it's that whole idea
of continual improvement

85
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,054
over and over again.

86
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:10,100
If we have recommendations
for contracts and agreements,

87
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,900
we're not going to give
those directly to the

88
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,560
consumers or the service
provides or any of our suppliers.

89
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,290
Instead, we're going to pass
that back to engage because

90
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,560
they're going to be our conduit

91
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,500
to all of those external agencies.

92
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,160
And so that's the way
we're going to do that

93
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,930
with any improvements for
contracts or agreement language.

94
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,870
And finally, we have our
service performance information

95
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,500
for design and transition.

96
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,240
As we get all of that information,

97
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,770
and we look at how we can improve it,

98
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:36,830
we're also going to push that
back to design and transition

99
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,610
so they can design and transition

100
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,820
better services next time around.

101
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,210
This all goes back to the

102
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,510
bottom line of continual improvement.

103
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,500
When we're thinking about the

104
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,290
value chain activity
of improve, just think,

105
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,910
how could we make things
better, faster, cheaper, easier,

106
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,570
better functionality,
whatever the case may be,

107
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,930
however we can move and get

108
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,370
more improvement and better results,

109
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,153
that's the idea inside
the improve activity.
