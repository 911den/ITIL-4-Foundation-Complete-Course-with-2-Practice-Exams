1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,940
- Service management practices.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,110
Service management practices
have been developed

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,150
in the service management

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,200
and IT service management industries

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,550
over the last 20 to 30 years.

6
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,450
Under ITIL 4, there are 17 practices

7
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,150
that are going to be in the
service management category.

8
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,710
We're going to briefly cover all of them

9
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,640
in this section of the course.

10
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,610
Now, of these 17 practices,

11
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,620
you need to know six of them in depth,

12
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,860
and you need to know four of them

13
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,250
at the recall level of the exam.

14
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,070
On the exam, you have to be
able to understand and explain

15
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,570
how change control, incident management,

16
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,950
problem management, service
desk, service level management,

17
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,520
and service request management
practices work and function.

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,050
Also, you need to be able
to recall the purposes

19
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,670
of IT asset management,

20
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,380
monitoring and event
management, release management,

21
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,150
and service configuration
management practices.

22
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,010
After we've covered those first 10,

23
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,130
then we're going to go and
cover the rest of them.

24
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,640
And these are ones that
we're going to cover

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,110
just for a general awareness,

26
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,220
not that you need to
know them for the exam.

27
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,470
This includes availability
management, business analysis,

28
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,360
capacity and performance management,

29
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,900
service catalog management,

30
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,630
service continuity
management, service design,

31
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,120
and service validation
and testing practices.

32
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,050
But again, these practices won't be

33
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,400
on your certification exam.
