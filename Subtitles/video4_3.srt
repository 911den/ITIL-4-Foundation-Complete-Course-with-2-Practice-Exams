00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,060
- Governance, in this
lesson we're going to

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,940
briefly revisit the concept of governance.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,580
And you see it here inside
the service value system.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,190
It's going to be part
of that internal piece

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,710
that takes our opportunities
and our demands,

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,780
works it through that middle
of the service value system

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,870
to come out the other side as value.

8
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,420
Now what is governance?

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,220
Well governance is the means by which

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,170
an organization is
directed and controlled.

11
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,430
I used the example
earlier, if you think about

12
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:33,130
your government, like the US
Congress, they do governance.

13
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,970
They provide the laws and regulations

14
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,980
that the rest of the company will follow.

15
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,290
Well inside of your organization,

16
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,250
you run governance as well.

17
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,940
Governance may be set up
by those in the C-suite,

18
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,270
your CEO, your CFO, your CIO, your CSO

19
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,310
or other high level executives.

20
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,910
You're going to come up with the way the

21
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,300
organization is going to
be directed and controlled

22
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,220
and then pass that down through governance

23
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,930
down to things like guidelines

24
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,410
and regulations and standards.

25
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,560
ITIL at its core is a
framework for governance.

26
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,570
But it's not a directive
framework for governance.

27
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,400
It's not going to tell you
that you have to follow

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,830
everything the way that ITIL say it is.

29
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,620
ITIL instead is a best practice

30
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,700
and you can write your
governance based on ITIL.

31
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,280
Now when we look at governance

32
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,550
at a large macro-level
in your organization,

33
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,460
it's the way you're going to do things.

34
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,570
You may come up with
processes and activities

35
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,350
and procedures for how
you're going to handle

36
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,110
something like change management.

37
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,450
Every time you want to
have a new server installed

38
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,270
it's got to go through this process

39
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,480
that has 15 different steps and these many

40
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,420
different approvals at this level.

41
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,020
That is part of governance.

42
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,850
The way you're going
to control and organize

43
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,720
and direct your organization.

44
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,010
That's the whole concept.

45
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,380
So if you think about governance like laws

46
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,910
but within your organization,

47
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,710
that's kind of the big concept of it.

48
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,980
And it is part of this
service value system

49
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,100
because that governance is
what you're going to build

50
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,780
your processes and your activities around

51
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,530
to make sure their inline with
the governances you put out

52
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,673
at that high level of your organization.
