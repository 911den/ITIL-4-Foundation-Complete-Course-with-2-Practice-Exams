1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,920
- Service Level Management.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,550
This is another one you
need to know in-depth.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,540
First, let's start with the purpose.

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,330
The purpose of the
service level management

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,180
practice is to set clear
business-based targets

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,370
for service performance
so that the delivery

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,976
of a service can be properly assessed,

8
00:00:15,976 --> 00:00:18,675
monitored, and managed
against these targets.

9
00:00:18,675 --> 00:00:21,100
It's going to provide us
with end to end visibility

10
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,770
of the organization's services.

11
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,110
It's going to do this by establishing

12
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,770
a shared view of the services and the

13
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,860
target service levels with the customers,

14
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,692
so both the customers and
us know what to expect.

15
00:00:30,692 --> 00:00:32,730
We're also going to focus on collecting,

16
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,340
analyzing, storing, and
reporting the relevant

17
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,020
metrics to ensure that we're meeting

18
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,490
the service levels.

19
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,760
We also want to make sure
that we're performing

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,580
service level reviews, to ensure the

21
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,080
current services continue to meet

22
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,495
the organization and the customer's needs.

23
00:00:45,495 --> 00:00:47,090
We also are going to make sure that we're

24
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,980
capturing and reporting service issues

25
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,330
including performance against our

26
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,050
defined service levels.

27
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,090
So, if I said I want
to have 99.999% uptime,

28
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,870
service level management
is going to measure

29
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,035
my performance and see if
I'm meeting that level.

30
00:01:01,035 --> 00:01:03,050
Now, all of these service levels

31
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,670
are going to be written
down in what's known

32
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,302
as an SLA, or a Service Level Agreement.

33
00:01:07,302 --> 00:01:09,880
A Service Level Agreement is a documented

34
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,500
agreement between a service provider

35
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,490
and a customer that identifies services

36
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,140
required and the expected
level of service.

37
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,920
This is going to tell you
what metrics you need to meet.

38
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,970
The SLA is a tool that's used to measure

39
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,590
the performance of services from

40
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,805
the customer's point of view.

41
00:01:23,805 --> 00:01:25,490
Now, there's a couple of things you need

42
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,900
to do to make sure that
you're going to have

43
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,710
a successful SLA.

44
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,270
First, you want to make sure it's

45
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,900
related to a defined service.

46
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,600
It can't be something generalized,

47
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,660
like customer is happy.

48
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,320
What is the customer happy with?

49
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,640
They're happy with the
email service delivery.

50
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,000
They want it to be fast, what
does fast really mean, right?

51
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,880
You need to make sure
you're defining the outcome

52
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,400
you want, not just operational metrics.

53
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,297
So, if the customer says "I want the

54
00:01:49,297 --> 00:01:52,050
"email to be fast" well, does that mean

55
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,470
if I get it there in five seconds

56
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,250
they're happy, or if I get there in

57
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,650
five minutes they're happy?

58
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,180
I need to be able to define, really

59
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,830
what does fast mean?

60
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,010
And I don't want to just do that from

61
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,900
an output perspective, but also from an

62
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,231
outcome perspective.

63
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:06,310
Also, we want to make sure our agreement

64
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,500
is between the service provider

65
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,060
and the service consumer, and it

66
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,510
reflects their opinions accurately.

67
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,022
Because if the customer says

68
00:02:13,022 --> 00:02:15,150
"The email service should be fast"

69
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,532
and they say five minutes is fast,

70
00:02:16,532 --> 00:02:19,290
but the customer, or the
consumer in this case,

71
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,770
would think that it needs to be fast

72
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,470
meaning five seconds,
there's a disconnect there.

73
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,290
So we want to make sure
we understand it both

74
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,560
from the customer's
perspective, in our contract

75
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,640
but also from our consumer's perspective,

76
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,005
because that's really what the SLA

77
00:02:31,005 --> 00:02:33,684
should be focused on, is
that server's consumer.

78
00:02:33,684 --> 00:02:36,160
And the final key to writing a good SLA

79
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,961
is making sure you write it simply.

80
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:40,870
Make sure that it's easy to
understand by all parties.

81
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,630
This isn't a contract, it doesn't need

82
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,570
to be written with legal jargon.

83
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,460
Instead, make it simple and easy,

84
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,660
so that anyone who picks it up

85
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,054
can understand what you're talking about.

86
00:02:49,054 --> 00:02:50,825
When you're writing your SLAs,

87
00:02:50,825 --> 00:02:52,540
you always want to be focused on the

88
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,940
different relationships.

89
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,090
That includes things like
relationship management,

90
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,780
your supplier management, the different

91
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,280
skills and competencies,
the business liaisons,

92
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,800
and the business analysts.

93
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,110
All of that is things that are going to

94
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,110
feed into this SLA, and making sure

95
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,080
we understand who's responsible for what,

96
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,620
and to what level.

97
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,430
Now, our service level management

98
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,390
is built around these
various information sources.

99
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,980
One of those is our SLA, right,

100
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,280
that's the customer engagement

101
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,040
and the agreement we have.

102
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,630
Other things that we have, is going to be

103
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,060
things like our customer engagement

104
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,980
where we're listening
to our customers needs.

105
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,460
We're discovery and capturing the

106
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,090
information they want from them.

107
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,250
We want to get the measurement and

108
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,006
the ongoing process discussions with them.

109
00:03:29,006 --> 00:03:31,830
We also want to ask simple
open-ended questions.

110
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,510
By getting that information, from our

111
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,385
service desk, or our customer liaisons,

112
00:03:35,385 --> 00:03:37,440
we can get a lot of
the information we need

113
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,501
to build a good service
level management program.

114
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:43,540
And then, afterwards, we want
to get customer feedback.

115
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,300
This can be something like a survey,

116
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,895
or looking at key business-related
measures and metrics.

117
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,090
We might be look at some
operational metrics,

118
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,120
like server uptime and capacity.

119
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,560
We might look at some business metrics,

120
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,210
like monthly recurring revenue, or

121
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,695
lifetime value of a customer.

122
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:59,610
All of that can go in to this
service level management,

123
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,380
as something that feeds
into this practice.

124
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,450
Now as we look at this, and we see

125
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,500
how it affects our value chain activity,

126
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,610
let's talk about the plan activity.

127
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,420
In the plan activity, your service level

128
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,920
management is going to
support the planning

129
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,520
of your products and your service

130
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,440
portfolio, and your service offerings.

131
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,030
Because all the information you get

132
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,010
about the actual service
performance and trends

133
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,598
is going to feed into all that planning.

134
00:04:19,598 --> 00:04:22,100
When you think about it from
the improve perspective,

135
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,620
service level management can help

136
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,600
be a driving force for continual

137
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,460
improvement and service improvement.

138
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,660
You saw that when we talked about the

139
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,960
different steps of the
continual improvement model.

140
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,700
We had to measure things, and then see

141
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,960
if we met those targets.

142
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,972
That's what SLM is all about.

143
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:38,810
We think about engage,
service level management

144
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,410
ensures we have ongoing engagement

145
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,869
with our customers and our users

146
00:04:41,869 --> 00:04:43,700
through the feedback processes,

147
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,390
and we're continually getting information

148
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,916
from them for review.

149
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,560
Now when we think about this from a

150
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,250
design and transition perspective,

151
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,610
service level management provides

152
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,470
an input to the design and development

153
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,100
of new and changed services.

154
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,110
If the customer wants fast email,

155
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,852
that's going to be less
than five second delivery,

156
00:04:58,852 --> 00:05:00,550
then we need to design a system

157
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,900
that can meet that requirement.

158
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,683
And so, this is going
to be an input to that.

159
00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:05,640
When we think about obtain and build,

160
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,040
service level management provides

161
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,750
objectives for components and service

162
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,550
performance, as well as measurement

163
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,910
and reporting capabilities for the

164
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,710
products and services we use.

165
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,740
So, obtain and build is going to get a lot

166
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,780
of input from service level management.

167
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,870
And finally, deliver and support.

168
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,610
service level management communicates

169
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,150
the service performance objectives

170
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,030
to the operations and support teams,

171
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,170
so they know what they're
trying to maintain.

172
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,430
It's also going to collect information

173
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,998
and feedback from them as an input

174
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:32,800
back into the service level management

175
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,030
and service improvements that we're

176
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,230
going to do in the future.

177
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,840
So, this is the way it works.

178
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,610
service level management is all about

179
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,130
these measures and metrics.

180
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,920
Setting up the right ones, doing the

181
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,710
engagement with the customer, to make sure

182
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,040
we're measuring the right things
