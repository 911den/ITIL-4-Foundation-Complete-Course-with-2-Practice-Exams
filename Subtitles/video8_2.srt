1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,360
- In this section of the course,

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,210
we're going to cover the
general management practices.

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:09,060
This is the first of three
categories of ITIL practices.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,780
Inside this category,
we're going to cover 14

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,080
of the 34 ITIL practices.

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,520
First, we're going to talk
about continual improvement,

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,330
and this is one that you
have to know in-depth, then,

8
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,630
we're going to talk about
information security management,

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,140
relationship management,
and supplier management.

10
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,630
These three are at the
recall level of knowledge,

11
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,730
so you need to memorize their definition.

12
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,280
And then, we're going to
cover all of the other 10

13
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,740
inside this category, and
these are just going to be

14
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,940
for a general awareness.

15
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,980
You don't need to know them for the exam.

16
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,910
This includes architecture management,

17
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,540
knowledge management,
measurement and reporting,

18
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,240
organizational change management,

19
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,840
portfolio management, project management,

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,620
risk management, service
financial management,

21
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,090
strategy management, and
workforce and talent management.

22
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,130
Now, all of these general
management principles

23
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,810
have been adopted and adapted
for service management

24
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,210
for more general business
management domains.

25
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,100
For example, project management

26
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,040
and portfolio management are not something

27
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,200
that only occur inside the IT world.

28
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,920
We use these across all
business organizations.

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,430
And that's why these are considered

30
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,410
general business management domains.

31
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,080
And that's why we're
going to cover them here

32
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,723
in the category of general
management practices.
