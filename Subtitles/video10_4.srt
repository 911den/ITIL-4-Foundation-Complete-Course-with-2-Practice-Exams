1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,620
- Our third technical
management practice is

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,600
Software Development and Management.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,379
Again, this one is not
covered by the exam.

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,950
The software development
and management practice

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,120
is responsible for
ensuring that applications

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,140
meet stakeholder needs in
terms of their functionality,

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,230
their reliability, their
maintainability, their compliance,

8
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,940
and their auditability.

9
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,430
So, whether we're developing it in-house

10
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,200
or we're going to be deploying
other people's software

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,430
into our environment,

12
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,440
it's going to be handled
through this practice.

13
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,640
So if I'm going to go ahead and
install Windows Server 2019,

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,870
that is going to be done
and managed through software

15
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,400
development and management.

16
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,439
We're going to make sure
that that software meets our

17
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:41,720
functionality needs,
our reliability needs,

18
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,070
our maintainability needs,
our compliance needs,

19
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,640
and our auditability needs.

20
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,480
Now, we're not going to be
the ones who are going to push

21
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,900
that out into the environment.

22
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,205
That's going to happen through release

23
00:00:51,205 --> 00:00:52,038
and deployment management.

24
00:00:52,038 --> 00:00:53,880
But we're going to make
sure we're tracking it

25
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,060
all along the way and we
know what applications

26
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,760
are out there that are meeting
our stakeholders needs.
