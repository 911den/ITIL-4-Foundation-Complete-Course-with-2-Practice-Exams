1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,080
- Problem management, this is another one

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,770
that you need to know in depth.

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,550
Now for the exam, I want you to remember

4
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,300
the purpose of problem management.

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,460
This is to reduce the
likelihood and impact

6
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,600
of incidents by identifying actual

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,440
and potential causes of incidents

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,260
and managing workarounds and known errors.

9
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,380
In this definition, there's two key terms

10
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,540
that you need to be able
to recall for the exam.

11
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,730
They're the words problem
and a known error.

12
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,970
Now a problem is a cause or potential

13
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,020
cause of one or more incidents.

14
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,900
Remember, an incident is an unplanned

15
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,840
interruption to a service or a reduction

16
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,410
in the quality of that service.

17
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,100
If this happens more than once
to the same type of thing,

18
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,140
then it becomes a problem.

19
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,710
Sometimes though a problem can

20
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,890
be classified as a known error.

21
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,640
A known error is a problem that has been

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,250
analyzed and has not been resolved yet.

23
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,270
For example, we recently underwent

24
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,160
a website migration from
one server to another.

25
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,620
During that migration,
we found that the log in

26
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,460
link on our website was routing
users to the wrong place.

27
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,110
And it was preventing them from logging in

28
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,760
and accessing their training.

29
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,900
Now while our web developer
was working to resolve

30
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,160
the underlying issue,
we were able to notify

31
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,160
our users of this issue and we told them

32
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,180
that we had a known error
and gave them a direct

33
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,660
link to use to access the login page.

34
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,650
By giving our users this direct link,

35
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,160
we created what's known as a workaround.

36
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,670
A workaround is a solution
that reduces or eliminates

37
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,410
the impact of an incident
or problem for which a full

38
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,730
resolution is not yet available.

39
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,840
Sometimes these workarounds
will help you to reduce

40
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,040
the likelihood of incidents
from occurring again,

41
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,820
and these workarounds are documented

42
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,590
in your problem records.

43
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,990
Workarounds can then be
created at any stage,

44
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,080
and they don't need to wait
for you to fully analyze

45
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,400
the problem and have the
full complete solution done.

46
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,770
Instead, if you have a
workaround that's been documented

47
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,720
early in the problem control stage,

48
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,830
then this can be reviewed and improved

49
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,670
after the problem analysis
is fully completed.

50
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,170
So when we talk about problem
management, at its core,

51
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,670
we have three major steps inside of it.

52
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,850
The first is problem identification.

53
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,600
The second is problem control.

54
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,610
And the third is error control.

55
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,600
When we talk about problem identification,

56
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,420
here's what we're looking at
things like trend analysis,

57
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,530
identifying what recurring
incidents or major

58
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,010
incidents have happened, we're
looking at all the supplier

59
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:11,440
and partner information,
the software developers,

60
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,210
testers, and projects that are on-going.

61
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,490
And identifying any possible issues

62
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,700
that may turn into problems for us.

63
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,200
When we look at problem control,

64
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,130
we're trying to prioritize
and manage based on the risk.

65
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,470
We might have 5 or 6 or 7 problems,

66
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,660
but we only have enough time and money

67
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,230
to solve one of them right now.

68
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,700
Which one should we do first?

69
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,470
Well that becomes a prioritization

70
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,110
and risk management decision.

71
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,290
Also, we want to do our problem analysis

72
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,770
from the perspective
of all four dimensions.

73
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,990
We want to think about it
through all four of those lenses,

74
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,380
because it might be a problem
that can be solved with people

75
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,220
as opposed to technology or vice versa.

76
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,160
And then we go into error control.

77
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,680
With error control
we're trying to identify

78
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,570
potential permanent
solutions for this problem.

79
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,350
This allows us to reassess
any status of known errors

80
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,460
and improve our workarounds
so that we can solve

81
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,590
a lot of these problems.

82
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,810
Problem management is a
practice that relies heavily

83
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,730
on other practices as well.

84
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,890
Problem management has a
large amount of overlap

85
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,960
with the incident
management, risk management,

86
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,270
change control, knowledge management,

87
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,460
and continual improvement practices.

88
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,420
Each of these practices
will either provide

89
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,850
an input to problem management,

90
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,050
or receive information
from problem management

91
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,190
to better do their own jobs.

92
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,870
Now when we think about problem management

93
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,220
and the value chain activities,

94
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,450
it does impact a lot of them.

95
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,910
Let's start with improve.

96
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,100
When we think about
improve, problem management

97
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,560
and doing it effectively is
going to provide us a better

98
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,640
understanding of what needs to be done

99
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,710
to reduce the number
of incidents, thereby,

100
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,290
improving our services and our products.

101
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,330
Now engage on the other
hand, is going to be where

102
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,010
we take problems that
have significant impact

103
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,880
to our services, and tell our users

104
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,170
and our customers about it.

105
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,350
If we're telling our
customers or users something,

106
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,393
that's engage.

107
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:47,610
When we think about it from
a design and transition

108
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,700
perspective, problem
management is going to provide

109
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,820
information that helps
us to improve testing

110
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,430
and knowledge transfer from
those who are designing

111
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,600
and transitioning those
services into the real world.

112
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,980
And once they hit the real
world to deliver and support,

113
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,890
that's when your service
analysts have to know about it.

114
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,030
When we look at it from an
obtain and build perspective,

115
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,420
it's very similar to this.

116
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,090
Problem management activities
are going to help us

117
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,680
identify product defects
that are managed as part

118
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,610
of the overall value chain activity.

119
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,380
And we want to transfer that
information to the transition

120
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,610
team and to the deliver and support team.

121
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,450
And when we look at the
deliver and support,

122
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,470
problem management is
going to make a significant

123
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,130
contribution here, just like
incident management did.

124
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,700
Because as we identify
repetition of incidents,

125
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,102
we can then try to find
timely incident resolution

126
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,430
and solve them for the longer term

127
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,610
by solving the underlying problem.

128
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,820
That's the way we want to do this

129
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,220
as we look at problem management.

130
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,250
We want to find things that
happen again and again and again

131
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,710
and solve the root cause,
instead of having to keep

132
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,810
playing Whack-a-Mole with all
of the minor little incidents.

133
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,170
That's the whole goal here,

134
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,270
inside of the project management practice.
