1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,110
- Categories of practices.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,050
Over the next three
sections of the course,

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:09,090
we're going to cover all 34
of the ITIL four practices.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,030
These 34 individual practices

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,470
are divided up into three categories.

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,550
General management practices,
service management practices,

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,780
and technical management practices.

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,250
This begs the question though,

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,560
what exactly is a practice?

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,100
You may remember from our
service value system lesson

11
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,570
that there was a portion of the diagram

12
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,370
that called out these practices.

13
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,410
Well, a practice is a set
of organized resources

14
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,740
designed for performing work
or accomplishing an objective.

15
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,250
Each practice is going to support

16
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,350
multiple service value chain activities,

17
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,910
and it includes resources based on

18
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,420
the four dimensions of
IT service management.

19
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,010
So, in this section of the course,

20
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,590
we're going to focus on the
first 14 practices of ITIL four.

21
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,680
These are known as the
general management practices.

22
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,790
But, before we dive into those
general management practices,

23
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,040
let me cover what you
need to know for the exam,

24
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,280
because we're going to
cover a lot of information

25
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,600
during the next three
sections of the course.

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,020
First, you need to be
able to recall the purpose

27
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,290
of 15 of the ITIL practices.

28
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,630
I'm not going to list each
of those 15 right now.

29
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,840
But instead, as we cover each
practice in it's own video,

30
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,020
I'm going to tell you whether you need

31
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,270
to recall it for the exam or not.

32
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,220
For these 15 practices though,

33
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,710
you need to remember the definition,

34
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,370
since these are at the recall level

35
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,120
of knowledge for the exam.

36
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,140
Just as a reminder,

37
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,060
there are 34 practices
inside of ITIL four,

38
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,690
and while I'm going to cover
each of these at least briefly,

39
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:28,560
this is going to help you get

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,880
a general awareness of
each of the 34 of them,

41
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,240
you only really need to know 15 of them

42
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,370
for the foundation level of the exam.

43
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,750
And of these 15, there are six of them

44
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,790
that you have to know more in depth.

45
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,200
Again, when I cover
those specific practices,

46
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,750
I'm going to remind you that
these are very important

47
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,330
and you're going to have
to pay more attention

48
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,240
than just knowing the definition.

49
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,250
In fact, as we start
each of these sections

50
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,400
covering the different
categories of practices,

51
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,910
we're going to first cover the practices

52
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,430
that you have to know in depth.

53
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,970
Then, we're going to cover the practices

54
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,340
that you simply need to
recall the definition for.

55
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,150
And then, we're going to
finish out each section

56
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,530
with the practices that aren't covered

57
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,290
by the foundation exam, and instead,

58
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,880
are being covered just for
your general awareness.

59
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,000
As we go through these three
sections of the course,

60
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,730
we're also going to cover the seven terms

61
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,140
that are under the recall level
of knowledge for the exam.

62
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,240
And we're going to do this throughout

63
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,990
our discussion of these practices.

64
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,980
These are the IT asset,
event, configuration item,

65
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,810
change, incident,
problem, and known error.

66
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,130
When we get to them in the lessons,

67
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,340
I'm going to remind you again
that these are the terms

68
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,710
that you have to memorize
the definitions for.

69
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,540
So, with all of that said,

70
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,193
let's dive in to the general
management practices.
