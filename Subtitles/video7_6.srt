1
00:00:00,395 --> 00:00:01,731
- How do we get there?

2
00:00:01,731 --> 00:00:04,269
It's finally time to
plan for some changes.

3
00:00:04,269 --> 00:00:06,575
Up to this point, we've
agreed upon the vision,

4
00:00:06,575 --> 00:00:08,429
we've created our baseline to determine

5
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:10,189
what the current state
actually looks like,

6
00:00:10,189 --> 00:00:11,979
and then we determine what the proper

7
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:14,291
goals and metrics are for us to aim for.

8
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:16,640
Now, we want to ask the fourth question,

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,269
known as step four, how do we get there?

10
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,899
So in step four, we are
going to create a plan.

11
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:24,459
This plan may be
straightforward and direct

12
00:00:24,459 --> 00:00:25,779
and provide us the quickest route

13
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:28,189
to completing a single,
simple improvement,

14
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:30,189
or it could be more complex,

15
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:32,539
more involved, and made up of a series

16
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:35,320
of twisting roads or starts stops.

17
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,631
The most effective approach
to executing the improvement

18
00:00:37,631 --> 00:00:40,229
may not be clear at the beginning
of our planning efforts.

19
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:42,191
You may not know what right looks like.

20
00:00:42,191 --> 00:00:45,500
And so, if this is the case,
sometimes it may be necessary

21
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,020
to design experiments
that are going to test

22
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,572
which options have the most potential

23
00:00:49,572 --> 00:00:52,319
so you can figure out
which path to go down.

24
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:55,410
Either way, we want to plan
for how we're going to go

25
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,954
and get to the desired set of goals

26
00:00:56,954 --> 00:00:58,790
that we set out for ourselves.

27
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,291
And we're going to break
the improvement initiative

28
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:02,916
down into workable chunks or units.

29
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:04,580
After each portion is complete,

30
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,406
we're going to reassess where we are

31
00:01:06,406 --> 00:01:07,958
and if that planned set of actions

32
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:10,361
is getting us closer to our actual goals.

33
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:13,831
If you don't have a plan,
remember, you're planning to fail.

34
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:16,361
There is nothing worse than
an improvement initiative

35
00:01:16,361 --> 00:01:19,591
that flounders and fails simply
because no one ever created

36
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:22,576
a plan of action for the
organization to follow.

37
00:01:22,576 --> 00:01:25,211
Be a leader, determine how
we're going to get there,

38
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:26,961
and then we can move into step five

39
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,283
and finally take some action.
