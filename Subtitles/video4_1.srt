00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,619
- The Service Value System

2
00:00:02,619 --> 00:00:03,938
In this section of the course

3
00:00:03,938 --> 00:00:05,469
we are going to briefly describe

4
00:00:05,469 --> 00:00:07,750
the service value system.

5
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:08,918
Now this ties back to one of the

6
00:00:08,918 --> 00:00:11,020
objectives on the exam, which is to

7
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,240
describe the service value system.

8
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,880
So of the exam, you need to make

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,480
sure you understand what the service value

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,339
system is and the components that

11
00:00:18,339 --> 00:00:21,260
make up this service value system.

12
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,093
So lets start with,

13
00:00:22,093 --> 00:00:24,330
What is the service value system?

14
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,640
Well, the service value system

15
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,250
or the SVS, is going to describe

16
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,170
how all of the components and activities

17
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,090
of your organization
work together as a system

18
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,670
to enable value co-creation.

19
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,460
Now, these components and activities

20
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,820
are all tied together within the

21
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,730
organizations resources and they

22
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,620
can be configured and reconfigured

23
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,371
in multiple different combinations

24
00:00:44,371 --> 00:00:48,120
in this flexible way based
on the circumstances.

25
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,570
Now this is going to require some

26
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,901
integration and coordination of

27
00:00:50,901 --> 00:00:52,780
all of the different activities

28
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,730
and practices and teams
within the organization.

29
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:56,980
As well as different authorities and

30
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,010
responsibilities for this
to truly be effective.

31
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,451
Some organizations are much more

32
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:03,670
flexible than others, some are very

33
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,310
tight and stringent in their ways

34
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,120
but depending on your organization

35
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,510
and its culture, you are going to

36
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,600
be able to utilize this system

37
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,010
in a very rigid or very flexible manner

38
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,560
It just depends on your organization

39
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,250
and how you implement it.

40
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,040
Now the purpose of the service value

41
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,130
system is to ensure that your organization

42
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,032
is continually co-creating value

43
00:01:22,032 --> 00:01:24,011
with all of your stakeholders

44
00:01:24,011 --> 00:01:25,980
through the use and management

45
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,510
of the products and services that

46
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,960
you have within your organization.

47
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,520
Now when we look at this
service value system

48
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,957
its made up of three basic blocks

49
00:01:34,957 --> 00:01:36,590
that we're going to see.

50
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,710
You'll see on the left side we

51
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,730
have opportunity and
demand, that's our input.

52
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,900
We have on the right side, value

53
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,530
that's our output and then we have

54
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,360
all this stuff in the middle.

55
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,760
In the middle we have the service

56
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,610
value chain and we are going to dedicate

57
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,176
an entire section of this course

58
00:01:51,176 --> 00:01:53,648
to talking about the service value chain.

59
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:55,550
Around that service value chain

60
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,638
we also have governance and practices,

61
00:01:57,638 --> 00:01:59,250
we are going to talk a lot about

62
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,398
practices in their own
section of this course,

63
00:02:01,398 --> 00:02:03,318
which is the final three sections

64
00:02:03,318 --> 00:02:05,907
because there are thirty
four different practices

65
00:02:05,907 --> 00:02:08,750
inside of idle four that
we're going to cover.

66
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,370
And then we have governance which is

67
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,210
the way the organization is run.

68
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,340
We've talked a little bit about

69
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,710
governance before and we're going to

70
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,376
revisit that in this section.

71
00:02:16,376 --> 00:02:18,930
And then we have the guiding principles

72
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,516
and continual improvement and again

73
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,866
the guidance principles is a big concept

74
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:24,610
so we are going to spend an entire

75
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,250
section on that as well.

76
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,300
So before we go any further I just

77
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,370
want to say welcome to the service

78
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,130
value system and we are going to start

79
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,558
focusing on opportunity
and demand and value,

80
00:02:34,558 --> 00:02:37,423
those inputs and outputs,
in the next lesson.
