1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:02,270
- Outcomes.

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,700
Back when we discussed the
definition of a service,

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,560
we said that a service was a means

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,900
of enabling value co-creation
by facilitating outcomes

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,790
that a customer wants to achieve
without the customer having

6
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,600
to manage the specific costs and risks.

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,690
Now in this lesson, we're
going to dig into a single word

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,670
from that definition, the word outcome.

9
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,270
An outcome is a result
for a stakeholder enabled

10
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,260
by one or more outputs.

11
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,970
This is focused on the
customer's desired outcome,

12
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,470
not the service provider's though,

13
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,460
and this is important to understand.

14
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,780
Now, outcomes are important
to consider as part

15
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,460
of the balancing act between
the supported outcomes,

16
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,980
the removal of costs,
and the removal of risks

17
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,600
against unwanted or undesirable outcomes,

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,070
the cost, and the risk
that could be introduced

19
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,870
by the customer if they
decide to instead set up

20
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,960
and manage their own resources.

21
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,360
Now, let's consider an example

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,240
of what we're really discussing here.

23
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,300
In my local area, we have two
major ride-sharing companies

24
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,850
that operate, we have
Uber and we have Lyft.

25
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,240
Now, whichever you prefer
here really doesn't matter,

26
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,980
but I tend to take Uber
more often than Lyft myself.

27
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,150
Now, I really like these
ride-sharing services,

28
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,750
especially when I'm traveling
to a large downtown area

29
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,890
for a conference or a
convention or when I need

30
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,170
to get from the airport to my
house or something like that.

31
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,910
Now, as a customer, I
have a desired outcome.

32
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,720
I want to get from point A to
point B in the least amount

33
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,020
of time with a fair amount of cost.

34
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,850
For example, the last trip
I took to San Francisco,

35
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,730
I didn't even need to rent a
car because I simply used Uber

36
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,040
and Lyft to get from
the airport to my hotel

37
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,870
and from my hotel to various
locations around the city

38
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,900
that I needed to go to for my work.

39
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,390
Now, this allowed me to get
the outcome that I desired,

40
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,560
which was getting from point A to point B

41
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,940
in less time and with less hassle.

42
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,620
Now, because I used the Uber
app, I was able to reduce

43
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,520
my overall costs because I
didn't need to have a rental car.

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,840
I didn't need to spend
$75 per night to park

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,360
that rental car at my
hotel and I didn't need

46
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,880
to buy gas for that rental car.

47
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,940
I didn't need to purchase
insurance for the rental car.

48
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,200
You're getting the idea here.

49
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,680
I was able to remove a lot
of the costs because as

50
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,120
a customer, I simply paid
for the service every time

51
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,950
I needed it and I was able to
achieve my desired outcome,

52
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,160
getting from point A to point B.

53
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,280
Now, if we consider the risks involved,

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,640
I was able to reduce
some of my risk as well.

55
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,040
For example, I tend to
find it very difficult

56
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,550
to park in large cities,
especially near the areas

57
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,640
of town that I need to
visit for a work trip.

58
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,260
So when I used Uber, I
could eliminate the risk

59
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,380
of not finding adequate parking when I got

60
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,910
to my desired location.

61
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,780
Instead, I just get out
of the car and I'm there.

62
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,680
I also eliminated the
risk of somebody stealing

63
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,910
my rental car while it's
parked or breaking into it

64
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,130
and stealing my luggage.

65
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,870
All those type of things are eliminated

66
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,800
and it's no longer a risk for me.

67
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,450
Now, I think you're starting
to get the idea here.

68
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,710
There's lots of different costs
and lots of different risks

69
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:43,160
that can be reduced if
you're using a service

70
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,110
and I can gain the benefits
of the service as a customer

71
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,370
by using this ride-sharing
app instead of renting

72
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,160
my own car whenever I
travel to a big city.

73
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,450
Now conversely though, I
need to balance this with

74
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,980
the other side of the equation.

75
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,150
There's certain costs and
risks that I'm assuming

76
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,230
by choosing to use Uber or Lyft instead

77
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,560
of renting my own car.

78
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,310
First, there's cost imposed
upon me by the service provider.

79
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,470
Beyond the actual service
cost to get from point A

80
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,910
to point B, there's also a
requirement that I maintain

81
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,370
a smartphone to run the
app and I have to ensure

82
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,990
that I have a data plan on that smartphone

83
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,880
and I have to make sure that my smartphone

84
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,350
has enough battery power.

85
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,400
All of this are things that have to happen

86
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,320
so that I can connect
the app from my phone

87
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,970
to their central server in
order to order that Uber

88
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,330
to my location and have them pick me up.

89
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,950
Now, this goes back to our original point

90
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,440
about value, right?

91
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,780
Value is co-created and a
service is all about co-creating

92
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,490
value by facilitating those
outcomes that the customer wants

93
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,760
to achieve without the
customer having to manage

94
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,860
the specific costs and
risks of that service.

95
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,250
So, as a customer of this
ride-sharing service,

96
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,330
I need to co-create the
value of the service

97
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,860
by having a smartphone
and an active data plan

98
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,650
and enough battery power to run it.

99
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,570
Now, Uber on the other
hand, needs to ensure

100
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,900
that all the other technical
details of the service

101
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,070
are taken care of.

102
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,300
They're going to provide the
servers that enable the service,

103
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,750
they're going to enable the
technology and the software coding,

104
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,380
all of that other stuff.

105
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,730
Now, I mentioned that the
customer doesn't want to manage

106
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,690
the specific costs and risks.

107
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,070
What risk might there be
with using an Uber instead

108
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,790
of having your own rental car?

109
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,280
Well, I've had an occasion
or two where I've had to wait

110
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,800
for my Uber to arrive because
there's none in the area,

111
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,490
and sometimes this'll
take me 10 or 15 minutes.

112
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,450
Now, if I'm running a
really tight schedule,

113
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,430
there's a risk that I can miss my meeting.

114
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,110
There's also a risk
that a driver just isn't

115
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,850
in the area when I need one.

116
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,170
And so if you happen to go to
a city center where there's

117
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,400
a lot of Ubers and you
travel to a location

118
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,590
in the suburbs where
there's not a lot of Ubers,

119
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,360
well this can become a
problem when you're trying

120
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,180
to get a ride back to the city.

121
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,170
This is a risk that
you're going to assume.

122
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,430
If you had a rental car,
you wouldn't have this risk,

123
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,920
because you could simply jump in the car,

124
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,000
turn the key, and start driving.

125
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,360
Now as we have these costs
and risks that the service

126
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,060
has now imposed upon
me, as their customer,

127
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,500
I now have to decide whether
I should ultimately use

128
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,090
their service or say
it's not worth the effort

129
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,890
and I'll simply rent a car
and drive myself around.

130
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,430
Now, this is the idea that we're
all going to be thinking about

131
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,920
when we think about a service,

132
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,540
whether we're the one using the service

133
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,400
or the one providing the service.

134
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,030
That decision is going
to be based on value.

135
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,550
All of this comes back to value.

136
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,500
If the value's being co-created to achieve

137
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,100
the supported outcomes, then
the removal of the costs

138
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,260
and the removal of risk has to be greater

139
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,910
than the unintended consequences.

140
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,640
And if that's true, the
introduction of these new costs

141
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,140
or the introduction of new
risks has to be balanced

142
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,050
and shifted in the favor of
the consumer if you want them

143
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,130
to buy the service from
the service provider.

144
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,550
In this case, ordering
an Uber or a Lyft instead

145
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,770
of renting a car.

146
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,910
It's all just about
balancing this value, right?

147
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,140
If we're the service provider,

148
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,290
or a service provider organization
like Uber in this case,

149
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,470
we need to make sure that
we're giving more value

150
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,550
and removing more costs and
risks than we're introducing,

151
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,880
and this way, the customer
will want to use it.

152
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,540
Now, in order for the
customer to see the value

153
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,750
that we're generating,
this has to be true.

154
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,660
It has to tip the scales
towards the customer side.

155
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,450
Now, as the service provider,
we want to make sure

156
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,210
we're getting value in this, too.

157
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,030
If we're the customer,
we need to make sure

158
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,620
that we're not creating additional costs

159
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,800
or risks for ourselves
that outweigh the benefits

160
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,660
of the service that
we're going to consume.

161
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,440
So, if I'm going to go ahead
and outsource my servers,

162
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,690
I want to make sure that it's
cheaper for me to do that

163
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,850
and provides me more
value for me to do that

164
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,420
than just to simply
run the servers myself.

165
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,590
Now, each personal
organization is going to weigh

166
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,870
the value proposition and
they're going to determine

167
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,620
if it makes sense for them.

168
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,140
If it does, were going to have
a valid business agreement

169
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,120
and we're going to be able
to go into business together.

170
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,220
You're going to provide me a
service and I'm going to pay you

171
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,590
to do that as the
consumer or the customer.

172
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,840
So, going back to my
example of Uber or Lyft,

173
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,730
I find it works great
for me when I'm traveling

174
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,840
in a big city where
the parking prices tend

175
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,440
to be very high, the
traffic tends to be heavy,

176
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,380
and the number of drivers
around is quite abundant

177
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,440
so it's easy for me to
get a Lyft or an Uber

178
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,570
when I need one.

179
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,870
But when I travel to
more remote locations,

180
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,320
I prefer to have my own
rental car because it solves

181
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,360
the problem for me much
more efficiently because

182
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,810
there's less risk of me not
finding a parking space,

183
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,990
because parking is low-cost in those areas

184
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,300
and traffic is less of an
issue because I'm outside

185
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,420
the city center.

186
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,690
This is the whole idea
of balancing those pros

187
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,440
and those cons so we can make the idea

188
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,930
and figure out what
gives us the most value.

189
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,690
So, we've talked a lot
about outcomes so far in all

190
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,710
of these examples, but there's
also a similar concept known

191
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,900
as output that it's
important to understand

192
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,420
when you take the exam.

193
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,550
An output is a tangible
or intangible deliverable

194
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,300
or an artifact that's
created by an activity.

195
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,110
Now, for the exam you have to understand

196
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:23,100
the difference between
an output and an outcome.

197
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,270
Services facilitate outcomes
through one or more outputs.

198
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,800
So, what does that mean?

199
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,840
Well, an output could be a report,

200
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,480
it could be a bill that
you receive at the end

201
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,990
of the service that you've consumed,

202
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,010
or it can even be an email if you're using

203
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,340
a webmail service.

204
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,080
All of these things
are considered outputs.

205
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,170
They're that tangible item that comes out

206
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,690
of using that service.

207
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:43,950
Now, I like to think about this in

208
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,460
a more tangible way, though.

209
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,880
Consider this course.

210
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,500
When I'm writing and filming
this lesson, the output is

211
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,710
the final video that
you're watching right now,

212
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,550
but this isn't the outcome,
it's just the output.

213
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,800
So if the video isn't
the outcome, what is?

214
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,910
Well, it's the desired
value that you're trying

215
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,720
to achieve from this video.

216
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,260
In the case of this video and
the others in this course,

217
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,170
the outcome for a student
like you is to be able

218
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,660
to pass your ITIL 4 Foundation exam.

219
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,950
If you're able to do that
after watching these videos,

220
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,500
then you've achieved the
outcome that both you

221
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,980
and I have desired.

222
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,540
This is an important concept
and one that people often

223
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,330
confuse because the
output is easily measured,

224
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,320
but often the outcomes are not.

225
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,380
It's easy for me to create
an outline and list all

226
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,630
of the videos that we're going
to produce for this course.

227
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,870
We can say, for example, there's
going to be 100 videos in

228
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,303
this course and if I've already
filmed 12 of those videos,

229
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:34,270
then I'm 12% complete
with creating this course,

230
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,010
and so I have outputted
12% of the product.

231
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,100
Now, this is measuring
outputs though, right?

232
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,980
It's not measuring outcomes.

233
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,850
Do we know that 100
videos is the right number

234
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,060
to help you as a student?

235
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,280
Get from the beginning to
the end and pass the exam?

236
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,030
Well, if the outcome we want to achieve

237
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,660
is a student passing, then
100 videos might not be

238
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,730
the right measure.

239
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,500
Maybe it only takes 25 videos
or maybe it takes 200 videos.

240
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,860
We'll have to figure that out
and measure that as we go.

241
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,770
And as we figure out
what things are working,

242
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,210
what things aren't, we add
or we remove to the course

243
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,030
to make sure that our students
are always going to be able

244
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,520
to pass the exam.

245
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,710
Now, output is part of an
outcome, but there's more to it

246
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,990
than just outputs.

247
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,550
So, when you think of outcomes,
I want you to remember

248
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,880
that it's what you're able to achieve

249
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,730
as a result of the activity.

250
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,490
As a result of this interaction.

251
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,110
Not just the outputs
that are being created.

252
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,210
Going back to my Uber and Lyft example,

253
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,030
the outcome is me getting across town

254
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,720
and to my meeting on time
because of the service provided

255
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,050
by those companies.

256
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,050
The outcomes of taking
this course isn't to say

257
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,790
that you sat here and watched
100 videos for X number

258
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,000
of hours or whatever it happens to be.

259
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,050
But instead, it's focused
on you passing the exam.

260
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,900
That's the outcome that both
you and I want to achieve here.

261
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,160
Now, because of this, outcomes
can be a bit more intangible,

262
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,410
where outputs tend to
be much more tangible.

263
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,850
They're things you can
touch and feel like papers

264
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,490
and reports and things like that.

265
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,033
It also means that outputs
are easier to measure because

266
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:56,410
they're the results of an activity.

267
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,290
So, when building your service metrics,

268
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,970
be careful not to measure
just outputs, but instead,

269
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,040
you need to put some thought
behind how you're going to measure

270
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,550
your outcomes as well, because otherwise,

271
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,970
you're going to have
people working for you

272
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,370
that game the system.

273
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,240
They're going to be
pushing different things

274
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,830
to make it look like all
those outputs are really high,

275
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,160
but you're never going to
achieve the outcomes you want.

276
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,500
So really think about that as
you're building those metrics

277
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,063
and be sure to measure your
outcomes, not just your outputs.
