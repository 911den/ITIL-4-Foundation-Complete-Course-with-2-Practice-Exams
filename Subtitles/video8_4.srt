1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,250
- Information Security Management

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,170
Our next general management practice is

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,990
Information Security Management.

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,590
For the exam, you simply need
to recall the definition of

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,840
the Information Security
Management practice,

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,050
and that definition,

7
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,070
is that the Information
Security Management practice

8
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,350
is there to protect the information needed

9
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,310
by the organization to
conduct its business.

10
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,760
What is Information Security Management

11
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,250
really all about then?

12
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,300
Well, its all about understanding
and managing risks to

13
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,370
your Confidentiality,
Integrity, Availability,

14
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,870
Authentication and Non-repudiation of your

15
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,440
information systems.

16
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,900
If you think about it this way,

17
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,030
Information Security is
all about cyber security.

18
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,870
We want to prevent things
like data breaches,

19
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,700
and hackers from attacking us.

20
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,810
When we think about
confidentiality, we want to

21
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,500
make sure our data remains
confidential, which means

22
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,150
its safe from prying eyes.

23
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,630
We do this usually by encrypting our data,

24
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,470
and that way, somebody can't go in,

25
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,200
steal it, and look at it.

26
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,100
When we talk about integrity of our data,

27
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,120
we're really focused
on making sure the data

28
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,130
doesn't change, either
in transit, in use or

29
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,540
when its being stored.

30
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,160
To do this, we usually do
a hashing function against

31
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,140
the information,

32
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,490
and that gives us a
digital fingerprint so we

33
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,570
can know whether a file has been changed

34
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,410
by a malicious attacker.

35
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,920
When we talk about availability,

36
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,900
we're thinking about
things like making sure

37
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,149
that a customer can get
access to the data when

38
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:20,910
and where they need it.

39
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,760
So, if I had a website that
had great confidentiality

40
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,540
and great integrity, but
you could never access it,

41
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,100
well, then it has horrible
availability and it means

42
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,730
that service is going to fail.

43
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,520
So availability is really important.

44
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,860
The way that we get good
availability is by making

45
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,540
sure we have redundant systems,

46
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,430
and highly available systems,
such as ones that have

47
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,430
multiple connections to the outside world,

48
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,270
so we might have 2 internet connections,

49
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,950
we might have 2 sets of switches,

50
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,350
and 2 sets of servers, so if 1 goes down,

51
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,149
the other one can carry the load.

52
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:51,760
The next one we're going to
talk about is authentication,

53
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,870
and authentication is
concerned with making sure that

54
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,020
you are who you say you
are, when you're requesting

55
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,510
access to the information.

56
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,330
The most common form of authentication is

57
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,420
a username and password, but there's lots

58
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,130
of other ways to do authentication.

59
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,760
You might use a biometric
thumbprint, like I do

60
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,410
on my iPhone when I login,

61
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,240
or, my wife has an iPhone
X, she uses her face,

62
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,320
which again is a biometric method.

63
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,440
You might have a system where
when you login with your

64
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,580
username and password, it emails
back a code to your email,

65
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,220
that you then have to access
and then put that code in

66
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,540
to access the system.

67
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,709
That's a form of 2 factor authentication.

68
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:27,750
Other systems like this might send you

69
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,840
a text message code,
and so that way you can

70
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,350
verify you have your
phone, something you have,

71
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,320
and you know your username and
password, something you know.

72
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,440
Again, this is the whole
idea of authentication.

73
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,650
Proving you are who you say you are.

74
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,630
And that brings us to our
last one, Non-repudiation

75
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,749
With Non-repudiation,
we're trying to make sure

76
00:02:44,749 --> 00:02:47,080
that you are who you say you are,

77
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,480
and you can't say you
didn't do what you did.

78
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,940
Non-repudiation is really
focused on the fact of

79
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,430
if you took an action
on a website, you have

80
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,550
no way to say you didn't do it.

81
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,040
Now, there's lots of ways
to ensure Non-repudiation,

82
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,500
and most of them involve
having some form of proper

83
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,840
authentication.

84
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,210
For example, if I wanted
to have Non-repudiation

85
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,980
of an email I sent you, I can

86
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,160
digitally sign it with my private key,

87
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,330
and if I do that, it
means that nobody else

88
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,970
could've signed it with that private key,

89
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,800
because I'm the only one who has it,

90
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,270
and that means you know
I actually sent it.

91
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,200
So even if I said, "I
didn't send that email.",

92
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,070
you can go "Yeah you did,
I have proof right here."

93
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,480
That's the concept of Non-repudiation.

94
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,909
Now again, for the ITIL 4 exam, you only

95
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:31,300
need to know the purpose of
Information Security Management.

96
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,280
Again, that purpose is to
protect the information

97
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,370
needed by the organization
to conduct its business.

98
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,810
This is something you
want to make sure you have

99
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:39,770
down in your notes,

100
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,863
and you're memorizing before the exam.
