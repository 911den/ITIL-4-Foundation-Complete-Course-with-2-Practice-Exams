1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,450
- Service relationships, this is what

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,780
being a service provider is all about.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,660
To create value, an
organization has to provide more

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:09,830
than just a service.

5
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,310
They have to work with their
consumers and their customers

6
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,660
to build an ongoing relationship.

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,470
Now, in the business world,
just as in our love life,

8
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,780
relationships are challenging
and sometimes difficult.

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,830
In this lesson, we're going
to take a look at what

10
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,660
a service relationship is and
why it can be so complicated.

11
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,360
First, let's cover the definition
of a service relationship.

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,700
A service relationship is a cooperation

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,210
between the service provider
and a service consumer

14
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,830
that includes service
provision, service consumption

15
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,200
and service relationship management.

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,530
This is a fairly straight forward concept.

17
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,520
Basically, it's when two
organizations want to work together,

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,610
they have a relationship that's formed.

19
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,210
During this relationship,
one of these organizations

20
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,240
might assume the role
of the service provider

21
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,360
and the other becomes the consumer.

22
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,210
Right now, you and I have
a service relationship.

23
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,480
I'm the service provider
and you're the consumer

24
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,630
of the training service
that we're offering.

25
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,530
But like I said, it can be
much, much more complicated

26
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,363
than that.

27
00:01:05,363 --> 00:01:07,440
But I'm getting a little
ahead of myself here.

28
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,810
Let's first talk about service provision.

29
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,640
What is service provision?

30
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,410
Well, service provision is the
activities that are performed

31
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,310
by an organization to
provide the services.

32
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,550
This includes things like
managing the service provider's

33
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,480
resources, configuring them
to deliver the service,

34
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,000
providing access to the
resources to the users

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,420
and fulfilling the agreed
upon service actions,

36
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,430
as well as conducting
service level management

37
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,000
and even performing continual
improvement to their services.

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,350
Service provision can even
include supplying goods

39
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,080
to the consumer as well.

40
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,440
Now, let's consider when you
go and buy a new cell phone

41
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,500
from your cell phone service provider.

42
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,720
You walk into the store
and they give you a phone,

43
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,940
which is good, and they
activate your phone

44
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,630
by giving you a brand new phone number

45
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,130
and this is actually called
account provisioning.

46
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,070
This establishes your new user account,

47
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,540
your new phone number in this case.

48
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,960
And they assign different
features, such as voicemail

49
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,550
and text messages and a
data plan and other things

50
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,710
to your account.

51
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,810
By the time they're done,
you can walk out of the store

52
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,860
with your new phone, your new phone number

53
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,750
and working cellular service.

54
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,980
That is all service provisioning
by your service provider.

55
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,550
Now, when you walk out the
door, you're going to use

56
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,670
your new cell phone and now,
you're going to become a consumer

57
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,720
who's beginning to do what is
known as service consumption.

58
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,240
Service consumption includes
all the activities performed

59
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,180
by an organization or a single person

60
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,460
in the case of your new cell phone,

61
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,670
and this is going to allow you
to consume those new services.

62
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,040
Service consumption includes
things like the management

63
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,630
of the consumer's
resources that are needed

64
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,620
to use the service, such as you
paying your bill every month

65
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,850
to make sure the service
stays working, as well as

66
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,250
all the other actions
you perform to utilize

67
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,900
the provider's resources,
such as checking your email

68
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,110
or making phone calls
on your new smartphone.

69
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,540
Or it can even be requesting
new service actions

70
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,620
to be fulfilled.

71
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,570
For example, you might
be getting ready to fly

72
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,910
from one country to another

73
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,220
and you need your service provider

74
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,430
to enable data roaming on your phone.

75
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,860
This, again, is one of
those things that can happen

76
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,810
inside of service consumption.

77
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,500
When the consumer is doing something,

78
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,640
this is called service consumption.

79
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,500
Now, in addition to service provisioning

80
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,840
and service consumption,
there are some activities

81
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,810
that are done by both the service provider

82
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,270
and the service consumer

83
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,330
and when they do these things
together, they're trying

84
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,560
to enable value co-creation
to occur based upon the agreed

85
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,370
and available service offerings.

86
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,640
This is known as service
relationship management.

87
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,040
The most basic of the things
here are things like having

88
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,880
the consumer paying their bill on time,

89
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,270
so their monthly subscription
doesn't get canceled

90
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,040
and the service doesn't get turned off.

91
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,610
Or it may be that the service
provider needs to ensure

92
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,190
they're communicating with the consumer

93
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,500
about a possible network
outage that's going to occur

94
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,160
because this weekend there's
going to be a server upgrade.

95
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,840
This back and forth communication

96
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,670
is what we call service
relationship management.

97
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,160
So, now that we know a little bit

98
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,000
about service relationships,
including service provisioning,

99
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,690
service consumption and service
relationship management,

100
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,500
let's dig in to the complicated
portion of this topic,

101
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,650
the service relationship model.

102
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,960
As I said, business can be
complicated and because of this,

103
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,810
we have to consider the
different relationships

104
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,350
that are involved in any single service.

105
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,900
For example, let's consider
my website, diontraining.com.

106
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,740
We offer training services
over video to our students,

107
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,360
students just like you.

108
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,190
Now, if you're watching this
video on diontraining.com,

109
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,480
that means there are a lot

110
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,100
of different service relationships

111
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,930
that have already
occurred behind the scenes

112
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,480
to enable that to happen.

113
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,500
Let's place you in the Organization D spot

114
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,940
here on the far right.

115
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,800
Now, you want to watch this
video, but for that to happen,

116
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,390
the video has to get to you.

117
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,720
Well, that happens because you
have a service relationship

118
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,390
in place with our company.

119
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,730
In this relationship, you are the consumer

120
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,080
and we are the service provider.

121
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,420
Well, to make this work, we
rely on service providers

122
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,490
as well.

123
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,020
We don't host our own videos,
for example, but instead

124
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,840
we outsource that to a very
large video streaming company

125
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,800
with cloud servers all over the world

126
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,510
to ensure that you get the best quality

127
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,150
with the lowest latency.

128
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,890
Let's put them up here as Organization B.

129
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,240
Now, in the relationship
between Dion Training

130
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,010
and the video streaming
company, we are the consumer

131
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,990
and the video streaming company
is the service provider,

132
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,200
but that video streaming service we used,

133
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,870
they don't even own their own servers.

134
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,450
No, instead they rely on Google Cloud.

135
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,360
And that means the video streaming service

136
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,060
is actually a consumer, too.

137
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,630
Well, Google is going to
be their service provider,

138
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,680
but to make it even more
complicated, there are departments

139
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,410
inside of Google that work on IT systems.

140
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,410
Well, some of those people
are actually members

141
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,960
of my website and they take
this very same training

142
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,110
that you're in right now.

143
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,910
And so, when you're logged into my website

144
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,160
to watch those videos,

145
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,750
they're now going to be the consumers

146
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,920
and I'm the service provider once more.

147
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,520
You can see how this
interrelationship can get really messy

148
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,880
and really complicated.

149
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,920
The bottom line here is
I want you to realize

150
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,460
that in most cases,
organizations are going to be

151
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,230
both a service provider to someone

152
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,360
and as service consumer themselves.

153
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,160
This is what this diagram is showing

154
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,940
with just these four companies
we discussed in this example.

155
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,770
If I was going to draw
out every relationship

156
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,130
for every service offering
within my company,

157
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,550
I would have to fill 100
or more of these screens

158
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,740
because of all of the different
relationships we have,

159
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,650
and we're just a small company.

160
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,490
If you think about how messy
this would be for somebody

161
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,770
like Facebook or LinkedIn
or Microsoft or Google.

162
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,670
It can just blow your mind.

163
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,370
So, for the exam, I want you to remember,

164
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,430
your organization may
be a service provider

165
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,300
or a service consumer or it can be both.

166
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,080
It all depends on the scenario
and the service relationships

167
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,980
that are involved.
