1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,870
- [Instructor] Our next value chain

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:04,390
activity is Obtain/Build.

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,360
Now, the purpose of the Obtain/Build

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,380
value chain activity is to ensure

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,140
that service components are available

6
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,750
when and where they're needed

7
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,060
and they're going to meet the
agreed-upon specifications.

8
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,580
Simply put, if I'm going
to build a service,

9
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,530
I need to build it to the design criteria

10
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,460
that I was given from the
design & transition activity.

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,190
Now, there are a lot of
different inputs and outputs

12
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,277
when it comes to Obtain/Build.

13
00:00:28,277 --> 00:00:29,110
When we talk about inputs,

14
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,650
we're going to get them
from a variety of sources.

15
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,730
First, let's think about
architectures and policies.

16
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:35,990
We've talked a lot about this

17
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,590
and this is something
that comes from plans.

18
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:41,510
Plans is going to output the
architectures and policies

19
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,420
and lots of these different value chains

20
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,750
are going to use those

21
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,540
because if we know what the governance is

22
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,330
and the architecture and the
policies for our organization,

23
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,490
that helps us design and
transition a better service,

24
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,410
or in this case,

25
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:57,080
obtain and build it to
those proper specifications.

26
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,610
Next, we're going to look
at contracts and agreements.

27
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,230
As we get contracts and agreements

28
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,060
with external and internal
suppliers and partners,

29
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,160
those are all going to come as an input

30
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,131
from engage into this Obtain/Build.

31
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:12,120
Next, we're also going to
look at goods and services

32
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,070
and these goods and services
are going to be provided

33
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,210
by these external and internal
suppliers and partners.

34
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,260
Again, once we contract for something,

35
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,500
we then are going to get some
kind of good or service for it.

36
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,430
The information,

37
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,263
the interaction,

38
00:01:24,263 --> 00:01:26,110
and the engagement all comes from

39
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,170
the engage portion of that contract.

40
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,860
But, the actual physical
delivery and receipt

41
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,720
of the components,

42
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,553
the goods,

43
00:01:32,553 --> 00:01:33,386
and the services,

44
00:01:33,386 --> 00:01:36,970
that occurs inside the
Obtain/Build part of this activity.

45
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,450
And, that is going to
bring us to our next thing,

46
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,970
which is getting the
requirements and specifications

47
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,220
for what we want to obtain or build.

48
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,780
Where do we get the requirements
and specifications from?

49
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,530
Well, that comes from design & transition.

50
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,580
Somebody has designed this service

51
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,630
and they pass those designs to us

52
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,190
here in the Obtain/Build,

53
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,480
where we're actually going
to install the software,

54
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,810
purchase the servers,

55
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,500
get it all connected in network,

56
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,770
and then transition it into
the real live environment

57
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,460
when it goes back into
design & transition.

58
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,210
Another input to the
Obtain and Build activity

59
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,370
is improvement initiatives and plans.

60
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,300
And, these are going to come
from the improve activity

61
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,270
because the improve
activity has been looking at

62
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,150
how can we make things better?

63
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,500
Once they figure out those
processes and procedures

64
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,040
of how we can improve things,

65
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,030
they're going to pass
that back to Obtain/Build

66
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,210
so they can build those things.

67
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,970
Another thing we're
going to get from improve

68
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,060
is our improvement status reports.

69
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,920
Again, they're going to be
looking at our processes,

70
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,970
our procedures,

71
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,580
the lessons learned from before,

72
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,680
and help us improve
the way we do business.

73
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,180
Now, going back to our engage activity,

74
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,060
we're going to get
something from them as well.

75
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,200
We're going to get changes and
project initiation requests

76
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,060
from engage because as
a customer or a consumer

77
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,030
or an end user,

78
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,890
if I have a problem with a service,

79
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,830
I might put in a change request.

80
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,170
And if I put in that change request,

81
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,850
it's coming in through engage

82
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,750
because it's an external communication.

83
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,280
Once engage gets that request,

84
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,510
they're going to process it

85
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,980
and then pass it over
to us in Obtain/Build

86
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,780
so that we can obtain
or build the new service

87
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,710
to meet that customer need.

88
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,620
Other change requests may also be provided

89
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,010
from deliver & support

90
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,430
because the people who are
delivering and supporting things,

91
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,560
maybe there was a switch that went down.

92
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,930
Well, deliver & support
can put a change request

93
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,950
that says 'Switch number
one needs to be replaced'

94
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,700
and then here, in Obtain/Build,

95
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,000
we would go get a new switch

96
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,800
and replace switch number one.

97
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,430
Again, these processes
are all very interrelated.

98
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,970
And then, we get down to our
knowledge and information.

99
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,560
Again, the same two we've been
talking about a lot already:

100
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,920
knowledge and information about

101
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,660
new or changed product and services

102
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,920
is going to come from design & transition.

103
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,800
We need to know what design
& transition is going to do

104
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,680
for some new service so that we can then

105
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,550
build to that specification.

106
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,440
And, the other thing with
knowledge and information

107
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,360
is anything that comes from a
third-party service component.

108
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,320
That information is going
to come from engage as well

109
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,650
because engage is going to push that out

110
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,820
and get it from our third-party suppliers.

111
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,490
Now that we know all of the inputs,

112
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:03,720
let's talk about some of the outputs.

113
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,970
One of the outputs is service components

114
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,990
for delivery and support.

115
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,860
As I go and I build a service,

116
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,880
I'm going to build
different components for it.

117
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,570
I might build some software code

118
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,640
or a particular server
or a particular system.

119
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,520
Once I do and it goes into live operation,

120
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,420
it's no longer my problem as Obtain/Build.

121
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,470
It now gets transitioned
over to deliver & support,

122
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,400
who's going to run it on a daily basis

123
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,380
to give the end user what they need.

124
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,490
This can include things like spare parts,

125
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,510
consumables,

126
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,720
new functionality,

127
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,580
systems and software.

128
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,340
All of this stuff is stuff

129
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,500
that we can go and give
to deliver & support.

130
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
Generally, when it's something big,

131
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,340
like a new system or a new function,

132
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,240
it's going to go from Obtain/Build

133
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,970
back to transition and from
transition to deliver & support.

134
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,140
But if it's something small,

135
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,250
like a spare part or a consumable,

136
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,670
then it doesn't need to go
to design & transition again

137
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,760
and instead, it'll go
straight to deliver & support.

138
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,620
Let's say for example that I
built a brand new web service

139
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,180
and we want to get it out
into the live environment.

140
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,380
Well, we built it here in Obtain/Build

141
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,550
based on the designs that we
got from design & transition.

142
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,180
Now that we've built it though,

143
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,910
we're going to turn that back
over to design & transition

144
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,090
so that they can transition
that into the live environment

145
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:17,923
and from them,

146
00:05:17,923 --> 00:05:22,170
it's going to go back over
into the delivery and support.

147
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,130
You can see how all these
processes and activities

148
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,820
are going to tie together.

149
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,730
Another output from this activity

150
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,300
is knowledge and information about

151
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,160
our new and changed service components

152
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,530
to all of the other
value chain activities.

153
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,220
Any time I built something new,

154
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,990
I needed to tell everybody about it

155
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,400
so they know the functionality,

156
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,580
the capabilities,

157
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,060
how long that thing will last,

158
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,080
when it needs to be replaced or repaired

159
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,340
and we can plan for it.

160
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,670
We can design for it.

161
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,940
We can support it.

162
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,020
All of the other activities

163
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,000
are going to rely on this
knowledge & information.

164
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,380
And that's why having a good

165
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,440
knowledge management
process is really important.

166
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,860
Now, when we go back to
contracts and agreements,

167
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,440
we're going to send all that information

168
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,190
and the requirements we have for those

169
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,380
back to engage,

170
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,060
who's going to engage with
those external stakeholders,

171
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,893
those partners,

172
00:06:04,893 --> 00:06:06,080
and those suppliers.

173
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,600
And finally, we're going
to get all the information

174
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,800
about our own activity here
inside of the Obtain and Build

175
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,790
and we're going to collect
that performance information

176
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,010
and improvement opportunities

177
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,520
and pass that over to
the improve activity.

178
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,050
That way, they can consolidate that

179
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,940
and look holistically
across all of the activities

180
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,850
and figure out how we
can best improve ourself.

181
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,360
So, when it comes down to it,

182
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,570
and we've talked about
the value chain activity

183
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,090
of Obtain and Build,

184
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,100
I want you to think about
it pretty simply like this.

185
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,510
Any time we're going to buy
something and install it,

186
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,990
that's going to be part
of this Obtain/build.

187
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,980
If we're coding something and
we're creating a new service,

188
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,990
that's going to be inside Obtain/build.

189
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,010
It's when the thing is
actually being built

190
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,860
and developed and coded
based on the requirements

191
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,280
you got from design & transition.

192
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,240
Once it's ready,

193
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,470
you're going to turn that back over

194
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,120
either to design & transition

195
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,600
to formally transition
it to delivery & support

196
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,490
or in the case of something minor

197
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,580
like a replacement switch
or replacement hardware,

198
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,040
that might go directly
to deliver & support,

199
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,740
which we're going to talk about next.
