1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,650
- Technical management practices.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,850
This is our third and final category

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,190
of practices under ITIL 4.

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,420
Technical management
practices have been adapted

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,180
from technology management domains

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,260
for service management purposes
by expanding or shifting

7
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:18,160
their focus from a technology
solution to an IT service.

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,770
Under ITIL 4, there are only

9
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,500
three technical management
practices covered.

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,400
These are the deployment management,

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,260
infrastructure and platform management,

12
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,050
and software development
and management practices.

13
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,890
For the exam, only the
deployment management practice,

14
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,670
though, is testable,
and it's only examinable

15
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,230
at the recall level.

16
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,990
For that reason, this is going to be

17
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,623
a very short and quick
section of the course.
