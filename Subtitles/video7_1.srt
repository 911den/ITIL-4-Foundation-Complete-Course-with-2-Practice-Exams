1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,020
- Continual improvement.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,210
So we've spent a lot of time

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,580
going through each of the pieces

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,560
of the service value system.

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,190
In the last section we
covered the middle block

6
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,260
which was the service value chain.

7
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,500
Now we're going to move
to the lowest block

8
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,500
which is continual improvement.

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,470
You'll notice here that it is called out

10
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,120
in this purple block.

11
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,160
Now right above continual improvement

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,110
there's a block called practices.

13
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,820
And practices are going to be
the 34 distinct idle practices

14
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,630
that we're going to cover
throughout the course.

15
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,570
And oddly enough, continual
improvement is one of those 34.

16
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,980
So why is continual improvement
pulled out in the diagram

17
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,580
as its own activity shown here

18
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,890
in addition to the fact
that it's a practice?

19
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,280
Well, it's because continual
improvement is that important.

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,830
In everything we do we should
always be trying to improve.

21
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,550
And when we look at this
from the exam perspective,

22
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,890
continual improvement comes up twice.

23
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,590
First, you have to be able to recall

24
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,370
the purpose of the continual
improvement practice.

25
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,660
Notice the key word there is recall.

26
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,940
That means you have to be
able to know it word for word

27
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,540
and be able to identify
that definition on the exam.

28
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,830
Second, you also need to be
able to explain or discuss

29
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,110
how continual improvement

30
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,790
and the continual improvement model

31
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,900
fits within the service value chain

32
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,740
and the service value system.

33
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,480
So we're going to spend
this section of the course

34
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,800
talking specifically about
continual improvement.

35
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,580
Now, I said you have to be
able to recall the definition.

36
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,720
So, what is that definition?

37
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,850
Well, the purpose of the
continual improvement practice

38
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:35,180
is to align the organization's
practices and services

39
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,700
with changing business needs

40
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,350
through the ongoing identification

41
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,330
and improvement of services,
service components, practices,

42
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,370
or elements that are
involved in the efficient

43
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,410
and effective management
of products and services.

44
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,840
So, this is a very long definition.

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,340
But you need to be able to know it

46
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,731
because if they give you something

47
00:01:52,731 --> 00:01:54,570
where there's a fill in the blank

48
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,110
you have to pull in the right word.

49
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,720
If they give you this definition,

50
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,910
you need to be able to identify

51
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,550
that it is the continual
improvement practice.

52
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,150
That's the level of knowledge you need

53
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,680
for the recall part of the exam.

54
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,500
Now, as we go through
the rest of this section

55
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,490
I'm going to present to you the
continual improvement model,

56
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,540
how it fits into the service value chain,

57
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,180
and walk you through each step

58
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,930
of that continual improvement model

59
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,133
so you can understand it
and explain it on the exam.
