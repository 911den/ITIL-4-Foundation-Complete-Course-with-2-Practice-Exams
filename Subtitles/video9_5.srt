1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,370
- The service desk,
this is another practice

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,900
that you have to know in depth.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,550
Luckily, it's probably the one you

4
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,900
already know the most about,
because most of us have dealt

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,460
with a service desk at
some point in our life.

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,340
The purpose of the
service desk practice is

7
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,320
to capture demand for incident resolution

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,870
and service requests.

9
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,660
It should also be the entry
point or single point of contact

10
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,700
for your service provider
for all of its users.

11
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,610
Now, once that issue
request or query is received

12
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,110
by the service desk, they're
going to acknowledge it,

13
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,020
classify it, own it, and act upon it.

14
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,930
This is the process and the workflow

15
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:35,870
that's generally used for
a service desk practice.

16
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,250
Now, the reason why this
is your single point is

17
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,240
because your service
desk is going to be able

18
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,020
to take in everything,
whether it's a change request,

19
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,670
whether it's a request for service,

20
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,000
or whether it's an incident,

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,360
and they can route it
to the appropriate desk.

22
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,050
Now, this isn't the way service desks

23
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,430
were originally designed, though.

24
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,710
The role of the service desk has changed.

25
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,530
It used to be that we
had a simple help desk

26
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,380
that was there to solve technical issues.

27
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,070
But more recently, it's
become the one-stop shop

28
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,530
for everything between the
users and the service provider.

29
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,420
This new focus of the service desk is

30
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,790
to provide support for
the people and business,

31
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,290
rather than simply the technical issues.

32
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,440
Our service desk has a major influence

33
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,810
on the users' experience

34
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,950
and how the users are going to
perceive the service provider.

35
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,370
And so, it's really important

36
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,240
that we get the service desk right.

37
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,820
Now, because of this, the
service desk has become

38
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,500
really important, in
fact, for most people,

39
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,190
this is one of the
first places you'll work

40
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,470
when you work in IT service management.

41
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,020
The service desk has to have
a practical understanding

42
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,680
of the entire organization
and how it functions,

43
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,230
because they are the gatekeeper.

44
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,020
Everything comes into
them, and then they have

45
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,720
to route it to the right place.

46
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,440
This service desk has to
be the empathetic link

47
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,640
between the service
provider and its users.

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,850
And that's why, a lot of times,

49
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,110
you'll find it's not even
the most technical people

50
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,800
that work at the service desk.

51
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,070
The service desk, instead,

52
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,740
focuses on excellent
customer service experiences

53
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,580
with personal contact when
it's needed by the user.

54
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,030
This is why soft skills
are really important

55
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,080
over technical skills for
service desk personnel.

56
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,970
Your support and development
teams need to work

57
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,270
in close collaboration
with your service desk,

58
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,680
passing information to
and from the service desk,

59
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,950
because the service desk is
the one who's going to interact

60
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,940
with your users and know the needs

61
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,620
that they have and the demands.

62
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,990
When the customer calls up and says,

63
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,000
hey, what's the current
status of my ticket,

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,700
they're talking to the service
desk, not the technician.

65
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,860
And so, that technician needs
to make sure they're feeding

66
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,240
that information back to the service desk

67
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,980
so the service desk can
engage with the customer.

68
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,360
Now, how does a user
access the service desk

69
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,700
for assistance, though?

70
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,030
Well, this is going to
depend on your organization.

71
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,010
But you may rely on phone
calls, service portals,

72
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,660
live chat with a real
person, a chatbot, email,

73
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,830
walk-in services, text messages,

74
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,040
social media messaging, or
even discussion board forums.

75
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,710
It really depends on how
your company wants to do it.

76
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,470
Now, there are four main
types of service desks.

77
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,490
They are local, centralized,
virtual, and follow the sun.

78
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,300
With a local service desk,
these are going to be co-located

79
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,760
within or physically close
to the users that it serves.

80
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,880
This often is going to
aid in communication,

81
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,690
provides a very clear
presence of a person there,

82
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,430
and it can support a local language

83
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,440
or cultural differences, if needed.

84
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,110
But the big problem is,
it's often inefficient

85
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,210
and expensive, because you're
tying up a single person

86
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,760
to be inside this office, and
they may not have enough calls

87
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,340
to justify 40 hours a week of work.

88
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,940
Now, a centralized service desk,

89
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,060
on the other hand, tries to avoid that.

90
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,350
They try to put all of the
service desk people in one area,

91
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,850
and everyone calls a single 1-800 number

92
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,310
or goes to a certain
website to get support.

93
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,790
This can be very efficient
and cost-effective,

94
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,580
'cause it allows fewer staff to deal

95
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,650
with a much higher volume of calls.

96
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,590
But it might also be necessary for you

97
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,010
to still maintain some
kind of local presence,

98
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,620
because some of the staff
can't fix the problems

99
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,150
on the other side of the world
if they can't touch the desk.

100
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,180
And so, we try to handle
anything that we can remotely

101
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,660
through the centralized service desk,

102
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,730
while still maybe having one or two people

103
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,620
at a local service desk.

104
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,750
Then, we have a virtual service desk.

105
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,120
Now, because of the way we
have technology these days,

106
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,360
particularly the internet
and Voice over IP,

107
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,580
and all the corporate
support tools that we have,

108
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,670
it's possible for us to
give you the impression

109
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,990
that there's a single
centralized service desk,

110
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:15,040
when in fact, a virtual
service desk is used instead.

111
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,990
This virtual service desk allows agents

112
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,170
to work from multiple,

113
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:21,070
geographically-dispersed
locations all around the world.

114
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,250
It requires some sophisticated technology,

115
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,650
but it does allow us to have access

116
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,290
from anywhere in the world,
and we can route those calls

117
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,010
to the right agent, no matter what time

118
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,570
of the day it is, across the globe.

119
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,490
Our fourth model is what
we call follow the sun.

120
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,010
Follow the sun is where global
corporations have to combine

121
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,960
two or more geographically-dispersed
service desks

122
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,660
to provide 24-hour
follow-the-sun coverage.

123
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,700
For example, maybe we
had three service desks,

124
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,300
one in London, one in New
York, and one in India.

125
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,710
By doing that, as it's daylight in London,

126
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,940
they would take the calls.

127
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,600
Once it's daylight in America,

128
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,250
the New York office would take the calls.

129
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,820
And then once it's daylight in India,

130
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,940
they would take the calls.

131
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,330
Regardless of where the
customer is calling from,

132
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,320
it would be whichever
service desk was open

133
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,360
at that particular time, so
we can give a full 24 hours

134
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,830
of coverage using those
three service desks.

135
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,060
That's the idea here when we
talk about a service desk.

136
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,560
We want to make sure our user
has a place they can call

137
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,990
and get support from any time they need.

138
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,510
Now, how do you run an
effective service desk?

139
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,720
Well, you need to have effective
supporting technologies.

140
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,020
This is especially true
when you use a centralized,

141
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,710
virtual, or follow the
sun service desk model.

142
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,610
These systems might be things
like telephone systems,

143
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,970
workflow systems, workflow management

144
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,730
and resource planning systems,

145
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:38,350
knowledge bases, call recording
and remote access tools,

146
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,040
dashboards and monitoring tools,

147
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,960
configuration management
systems, and many others.

148
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,090
Now, when you're going to
put a service desk together,

149
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,160
you have to fill it with employees, right?

150
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,810
What should you look for
when you're hiring employees?

151
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,080
Well, when you're hiring employees

152
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,440
for a service desk position,
you should look for people

153
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,750
who have empathy, emotional intelligence,

154
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,590
effective communication skills,

155
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,230
excellent customer service skills,

156
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,810
an understanding of the business
priorities and the ability

157
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,010
to conduct incident
analysis and prioritization.

158
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,630
Notice, in that list,

159
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,540
I didn't highlight a strong
technical capability, did I?

160
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,150
Instead, a service desk may be technical,

161
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,420
but most of the time,
it doesn't have to be.

162
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,220
Most service desks are more focused

163
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,230
around the customer support
and customer service aspects.

164
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,630
They leave the technical details

165
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,320
to the higher level of tiered support

166
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,800
that's going to come in
when something's wrong.

167
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,220
Now, to finish up this
lesson, let's talk about

168
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,100
how the support desk integrates

169
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,820
with the value chain activities.

170
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,770
First, improve, the
service desk activities are

171
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,240
constantly monitoring
and evaluating support

172
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,590
for continual improvement,
alignment, and value creation.

173
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,180
They're going to get feedback from users,

174
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,430
collect that, and pass it

175
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,450
to the continual improvement
process or practice.

176
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,650
When we talk about engage,
the service desk is there

177
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,560
as our main channel for tactical

178
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,330
and operational engagement with users.

179
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,270
They're the ones contacting and talking

180
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,550
with the users on a daily basis.

181
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,360
When we talk about design and transition,

182
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,020
the service desk is going
to provide a channel

183
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,430
for communicating with users
about new and changed services.

184
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,880
The service desk, again,
is that engage part, right?

185
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,500
So we're going to get this
information from design

186
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,120
and transition, and pass
it out to everybody else.

187
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,780
Also, our service desk
personnel can participate

188
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,870
in release planning, testing,
and early live support.

189
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,260
When we think about obtain and build,

190
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,240
the service desk can also be involved

191
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,200
in acquiring service
components that are used

192
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,990
to fulfill service requests
and resolve our incidents.

193
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,840
Maybe somebody's hard drive has crashed.

194
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,820
You as a service desk analyst might go

195
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,090
and order the new hard drive.

196
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,220
That's part of obtain and build.

197
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,180
And finally, deliver and support.

198
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,620
This is where the service
desk is really focused.

199
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,540
The service desk is the coordination point

200
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,230
for managing all of the incidents,

201
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,490
all the problems, and all
of the service requests.

202
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,680
And so, it's really important
that you get it right

203
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,150
by making sure your service desk

204
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,750
has the right people employed,

205
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,960
that have been at the right training,

206
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,380
and they understand how the
whole organization works

207
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,763
to get the best value for your end users.
