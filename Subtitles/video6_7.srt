1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,370
- The third value chain activity

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,020
inside the center of the value chain

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,010
is deliver and support.

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,580
This is where a lot of us work
if we work in the IT world.

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,830
If you happen to work in IT support,

6
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,000
you probably work inside
of deliver and support.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,300
The purpose of deliver and
support as a value chain activity

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,630
is to ensure that the services
are delivered and supported

9
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,630
according to the agreed specifications

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,890
and stakeholder expectations.

11
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,000
I like to think about
this as service operation.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,640
We want to make sure the end user

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,760
is getting the service and
support that they need.

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,240
And that's why we call
it deliver and support.

15
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,710
I am going to deliver
some sort of capability

16
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,650
and support that end user.

17
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,280
When you're watching one of my videos,

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,810
you're using the deliver
and support process.

19
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,120
We are delivering that video to you,

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,220
and if you have a problem, we support you.

21
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,220
That's part of that particular service.

22
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,480
Now, as we design the next video,

23
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,920
that would go back to
design and transition.

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,210
As we're trying to film
and edit that next video,

25
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,610
that's obtain and build.

26
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,230
But once we have it ready and
you're ready to consume it,

27
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,330
that becomes deliver and support.

28
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,040
And the same thing works
inside our IT services.

29
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,940
If I'm building a new email server,

30
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,540
that's an obtain build.

31
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,130
Once it's out and you're
using that email server,

32
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,340
we're now in deliver and support.

33
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,190
So, what are some of the inputs

34
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,270
inside of deliver and support?

35
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,540
The first one is any new and
changed products and services

36
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,010
that are provided by
design and transition.

37
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,450
Remember, obtain build
is going to build it,

38
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,010
pass it back to transition,

39
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,850
and then transition is going to make sure

40
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,920
it gets smoothly put into the marketplace,

41
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,640
so that deliver and support
can then run it from there.

42
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,860
We're also going to have our
contracts and our agreements

43
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,270
with external and internal
suppliers and partners

44
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,630
provided to us from engage.

45
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,100
As engage does all the
external engagements,

46
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,120
we're then going to use those contracts

47
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,320
to get the things we need
inside of deliver and support.

48
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,200
We also are going to
get service components

49
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,130
provided to us by obtain and build.

50
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,040
As they built that new email server,

51
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,110
it's going to be
transitioned and eventually

52
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,160
we are going to get it here
in deliver and support.

53
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,630
Then we're going to get things
like improvement initiatives

54
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,490
and plans that are going to come out

55
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,530
of the improve process or
a value chain activity.

56
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,680
We're also going to get
improvement status reports

57
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,680
from the improve value chain activity.

58
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,270
We're going to get user
support tasks from engage,

59
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,210
because any time we're talking to a user,

60
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,250
that's an engagement function.

61
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,620
And we're also going to be looking at

62
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,080
the knowledge and information.

63
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,160
The knowledge and information

64
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,750
about our new and changed
service components and services

65
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,310
from design and transition
or obtain and build,

66
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,820
or the knowledge and information

67
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,840
about third-party service components

68
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,980
from our engage partnerships.

69
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,690
All of that is the way
we're going to get things

70
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,940
into this value chain activity.

71
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,280
Now, on the other side, we're
going to output a lot of things.

72
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,380
And we're going to output things

73
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,970
like the services that we're delivering

74
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,820
to our customers and users.

75
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,940
This is the thing that
you're actually using.

76
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,480
When you go to the website,

77
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,310
you're in the deliver and support

78
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,780
because you're taking
advantage of the delivery.

79
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,080
You're also going to get
the outputs of information

80
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,530
on the completion of user
support tasks for engage.

81
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,550
So if you have a problem and
you submitted a support ticket,

82
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,210
at some point, you're going to
get a result coming back to you

83
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,770
through the engage process

84
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,720
that says your ticket has been solved,

85
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,770
and here was the resolution.

86
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:11,920
Another thing you're going to get

87
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,280
is product and service
performance information

88
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,240
that comes out of engage and improve

89
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,030
as those value chain activities.

90
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,250
All of this needs to get
back out to that end user.

91
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,500
We're also going to output things

92
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,020
like improvement opportunities.

93
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,020
And as we figure out,

94
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,320
hey the way we're delivering
our videos isn't the best,

95
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,320
maybe we should do it this other way,

96
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,150
we would give that
improvement recommendation

97
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,290
and opportunity over to improve,

98
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,790
which then can consolidate
that, prioritize that,

99
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,900
and figure out how we're
going to better ourself

100
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,590
for the long term.

101
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,700
When we talk about improvements

102
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,760
for contracts and agreement requirements,

103
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,900
that's going to go into the
engage value chain activity.

104
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,220
And, if we look at all the
different change requests,

105
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,960
any of those that come in as
part of delivery and support,

106
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,400
we're going to output those
over to obtain and build,

107
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,550
so that they can obtain or build the thing

108
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,590
and change it to the way we need.

109
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,440
All of this are things, as you can see,

110
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,970
that interlock together.

111
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,540
They're all very much going
in and out all of the time.

112
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,100
And the last output we have

113
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,950
for the deliver and support activity,

114
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,170
is the service performance information.

115
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,320
We're going to collect a lot of
information about our services.

116
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,400
Maybe we're running servers
and we're finding out

117
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,570
how much space is left on a share drive,

118
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,870
or the uptime, or the
availability, or the capacity,

119
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,910
or the throughput.

120
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,230
All of that is service
performance information.

121
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,810
And as we collect all of that,

122
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,170
we're going to process
it and then pass it back

123
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,650
over to the design and transition phase.

124
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,870
Why would we give it to
design and transition?

125
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,700
Well, because they're constantly looking

126
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,150
at what capacity you have
and do you need more?

127
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,870
For example, if we had
one single web server

128
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,890
and we started seeing that the trend was

129
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:47,740
that we were using 80 or
90 or 95 percent capacity,

130
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,140
we want to make sure we're designing

131
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,540
version two of that web server,
with additional capacity.

132
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,710
Maybe that's moving to
a cloud architecture,

133
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,550
maybe that's moving to a
multi site homed environment,

134
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,700
or using a content distribution network.

135
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,950
Whatever that is, it has to be designed.

136
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,130
And so by feeding this service
performance information

137
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,708
back to design and transition,

138
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:08,360
they can help us design
what the next version

139
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,060
of our service is going to look like.
