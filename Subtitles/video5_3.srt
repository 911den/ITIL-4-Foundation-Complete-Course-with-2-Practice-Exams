1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,410
- Start Where You Are.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,610
Our second guiding principle
is to start where you are.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,880
This is a really important
guiding principle

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,010
because whenever you get
into an organization,

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,690
even if you're a brand new hire,

6
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,230
they already have existing
processes and services in place

7
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,520
and if you're brought
onboard to help improve that

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,050
through an improvement initiative,

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,830
you have to remember that
we don't want to start

10
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,450
with a blank slate each time.

11
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,931
We want to start where we are.

12
00:00:23,931 --> 00:00:26,910
If I had you come in and
I hired you to figure out

13
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,730
the best way to create
a new service or process

14
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,940
to do voucher fulfillment for my students,

15
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,280
every time somebody comes to our website

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,960
to buy an exam voucher,

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,820
you would have to look at the way

18
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,600
the current process is done.

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,110
Then you can figure out

20
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,210
what is the better way to do it, right?

21
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,190
But if you don't start with
where we currently are,

22
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,760
and you just start from a blank slate,

23
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,740
you're going to spend a
lot of time and resources

24
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,668
doing stuff that isn't the
way that we currently do it.

25
00:00:49,668 --> 00:00:51,950
And there's probably some amount of value

26
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,570
in the way we currently do it.

27
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,630
So whenever you're engaged
in an improvement initiative,

28
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,230
I don't want you to start over

29
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,450
without first looking at
what is already available

30
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:00,320
to be leveraged,

31
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,040
because something there
is probably valuable.

32
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,190
Now when you have a
decision on how to proceed,

33
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,630
you have to think about this based on

34
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,480
the accurate information that's obtained

35
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,090
through your direct observation

36
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,970
supported by appropriate
and effective measurement.

37
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,370
Again, if I have you come in,

38
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,030
you're going to look at
the way we currently do

39
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,280
voucher fulfillment.

40
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,070
If you looked at us about a year ago,

41
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,050
the way we did it was
a student would buy it

42
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,870
through our shopping cart on our website,

43
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,770
that would send an email to me,

44
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,410
I would then go and order the voucher,

45
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,560
take that voucher, put it in an email,

46
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,050
and email it back to the student.

47
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,190
It was a very manual process.

48
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,727
Now if you came in and
looked at that, you'd say,

49
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:35,537
"Hey, I can make this a lot better.

50
00:01:35,537 --> 00:01:36,517
"I can automate this.

51
00:01:36,517 --> 00:01:38,597
"We can do five or six different ways

52
00:01:38,597 --> 00:01:40,060
"of doing this process."

53
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,090
But if you looked at the
way we were doing it,

54
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,640
you'd at least know the proper steps

55
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,950
that need to be included,

56
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,680
which was we had to buy
the voucher from Axelos,

57
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,560
we then had to give that
voucher to our student,

58
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,960
and we had to collect
money from our students

59
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,130
for that voucher.

60
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,950
So we'd have to figure
out what those steps are.

61
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,060
By figuring out what the current steps are

62
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,120
and how fast it is or how slow it is

63
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,580
or what pain points there are,

64
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,650
you can then overcome them as
you're trying to go forward,

65
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,540
and some of those parts
of starting where you are

66
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,373
are useful.

67
00:02:05,373 --> 00:02:07,450
Some of those you're going
to decide aren't useful

68
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,090
and you'll push them away.

69
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,430
All of this is done by
measuring what you have,

70
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,050
and measurements should be
used to support your analysis

71
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,400
of what you're observing

72
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,550
rather than just simply replacing it.

73
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,040
Not everything can be measured

74
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,000
with zeros and ones and numbers.

75
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,730
Some things in data analytics,
we rely on way too much

76
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,100
and we oversee some of the basic things

77
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,400
that we should be observing
with our own eyes.

78
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,610
Again, if you came in and
looked at our voucher process,

79
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,100
it was very simple, right?

80
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,540
But that worked when we started out

81
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,450
because we were selling
maybe two vouchers a week.

82
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,840
Now we're selling a
lot of vouchers a week,

83
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,380
and if we had to do that all
manually it wouldn't work.

84
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,900
The timeline to deliver to our students

85
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,490
would take way too long,

86
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,260
so instead we've looked
at that using measurement,

87
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,870
we've gotten our time down
where now we deliver a voucher

88
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,712
in about five minutes, and
a lot of it is automated.

89
00:02:53,712 --> 00:02:55,700
Now there's still some
parts of the process

90
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,770
that are still manual,

91
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:57,900
but that's just because of the way

92
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,260
that those systems operate,

93
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,470
and we're going through and
we're constantly improving that

94
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,780
to reduce that time down

95
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,530
to give a better value and
experience for our customers.

96
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,750
Now, the act of measuring
can affect your results

97
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,700
and this is something that's
important to think about

98
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,670
because as you go through and
you try to measure everything

99
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,970
that's currently going on,

100
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,030
sometimes the people you're measuring

101
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,580
will change the way they're working

102
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,580
because they know they're being watched.

103
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,820
This happens a lot inside
the service desk area.

104
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,390
If you're doing something like measuring

105
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,590
how quickly a call is resolved,

106
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,140
what you'll start seeing is
that your first level agents

107
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,900
will close out trouble tickets

108
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,530
even before things are
solved for your consumers.

109
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,527
That means that your measurement
is going to go up, saying,

110
00:03:35,527 --> 00:03:37,057
"Oh, look how quickly we've been able to

111
00:03:37,057 --> 00:03:38,490
"resolve all these calls,"

112
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,100
but in reality your customers
aren't getting the value

113
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,770
they want because their
calls aren't being resolved.

114
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,100
I've seen this even at some places

115
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,470
like drive-through restaurants.

116
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,200
If you've ever gone through a McDonald's,

117
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,400
they have a counter and
they have a measurement

118
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,340
of 30 seconds to deliver
the food to you in your car

119
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,030
to get you on the road again.

120
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,430
But if they can't get
that, what do they do?

121
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,250
The tell you to pull off to a parking spot

122
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,030
so they can mark your order as complete,

123
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,300
and that way their timer stops,

124
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,060
even though you still
haven't gotten your food

125
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,720
and that way they can
help the next person.

126
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,150
You may be sitting there for
10 minutes to get your food.

127
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,740
Because they know they're being measured,

128
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,850
that's going to affect the results

129
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,640
because they're going to cheat the system.

130
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,200
Now when you set measurements,

131
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,800
another thing I want you to think about

132
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,734
is that when the
measurement becomes a target

133
00:04:17,734 --> 00:04:20,410
it ceases to be a good measure.

134
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,040
Going back to that McDonald's example.

135
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,280
If I say every car has to get
their food within 30 seconds

136
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,930
and that becomes the target,

137
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,810
we're no longer trying to give good food

138
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,510
or good value to the customer.

139
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,480
Instead we're just trying
to get them in and out

140
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,760
within 30 seconds.

141
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,670
So that is something
you have to be wary of.

142
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,070
Measurement is great in business.

143
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,690
We use measurement a lot.

144
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,090
But you want to make sure you're
measuring the right things

145
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,360
and it's not the target in and of itself.

146
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,910
You're measuring things to determine if

147
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,010
you're making progress towards the outcome

148
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,070
that you really want.

149
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,480
We talked about that
before when we talked about

150
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,500
measuring outputs versus
measuring outcomes.

151
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,505
This is an important concept to remember.

152
00:04:54,505 --> 00:04:57,160
When we talk about starting where you are,

153
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,142
how do we really apply
this guiding principle?

154
00:04:59,142 --> 00:05:01,770
First I want you to look at what exists

155
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,610
as objectively as possible.

156
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,457
You may come into a
new place and they say,

157
00:05:05,457 --> 00:05:07,127
"You're going to come
in because our current

158
00:05:07,127 --> 00:05:08,817
"service management system sucks.

159
00:05:08,817 --> 00:05:10,177
"It's bad, it's horrible,

160
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:11,597
"so we're hiring you as the new manager.

161
00:05:11,597 --> 00:05:13,410
"Come in and overhaul the place."

162
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,200
You may come in and your
first thing you want to do

163
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,060
is just delete everything
they have and start over.

164
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,490
Please resist that urge.

165
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,650
Instead look at what is there,

166
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,190
figure out what is useful
and what you can build upon.

167
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,230
You can determine if there
are successful practices

168
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,910
or services in place that
can be replicated or expanded

169
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,400
across the organization,

170
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,030
and you can determine the
things that are not successful

171
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,620
and those things that need to be changed

172
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,410
or deleted or removed.

173
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,750
You want to be applying your
risk management skills here

174
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,530
in your decision making progress

175
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,716
because if we decide to
just throw everything away

176
00:05:43,716 --> 00:05:45,340
and start from the beginning,

177
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,370
we're going to spend a lot more
time and assume a lot more risk

178
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,100
because it is a lot
easier to fix something

179
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,240
than it is to create something new.

180
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,610
Also you should recognize that sometimes

181
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,840
nothing from the current
state can be reused,

182
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,600
and you are going to simply
have to create a blank slate.

183
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,660
Now when you're going to do that,

184
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,920
you're going to have
to think about the way

185
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,110
to make that transition happen.

186
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,730
A good example of that
is my current website.

187
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,940
As we're filming this video

188
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,750
we're actually going through
a major website redesign

189
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,330
and overhaul, and it's not just a redesign

190
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,110
of the website itself and
how it looks and feels,

191
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,850
but all of the underlying
services are being rebuilt

192
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,150
from the ground up.

193
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,810
The current provider we were on

194
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,440
was great when we had just a
couple of hundred students,

195
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,580
but as we've grown they can't
support the demand anymore

196
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,710
and their processes just don't work well

197
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,690
for the long-term vision of our company.

198
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,950
So instead we're building
a brand new system

199
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,000
from the ground up.

200
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,670
We have a brand new operating system,

201
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:40,490
brand new servers, a
brand new cloud provider,

202
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,840
and we've built the
entire application layer

203
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,410
that does the course delivery ourself.

204
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,090
All of that means we've
taken a huge amount of risk

205
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,380
because we're migrating from
something that we know works

206
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,130
into something that we're
trying to make work.

207
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,660
So because of that we have
to use proper risk management

208
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,020
and do mitigations.

209
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,470
One of those is we broke
up the phase deployment

210
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,400
of moving things over in pieces,

211
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,020
so as we brought up the new site

212
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,750
we brought over the homepage first

213
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,390
but we didn't bring over the shopping cart

214
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,930
and we didn't bring over the
content and lesson delivery.

215
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,250
Next we're bringing over
the shopping cart pieces,

216
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,490
making sure that all works,

217
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,350
and then we're going to
bring over the big bulk

218
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,360
which is our learning management system.

219
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,710
We're doing this over a
two or a three month period

220
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,990
in very deliberate phased approaches,

221
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,540
and by the time we're done

222
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,230
most of what we had on the old site

223
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,550
is not going to be reused.

224
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,920
It's going to be thrown away

225
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,030
because a lot of that doesn't
apply on the new systems

226
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,680
and the new services we've built.

227
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,800
So that sometimes is
where you're going to be,

228
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,200
but I would implore to
you always think about

229
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,390
what can be reused from the current system

230
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,520
to the old system.

231
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,440
In our case, a lot of our old training

232
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,600
was able to be brought over.

233
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,460
Our practice exams were
able to be brought over.

234
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,850
Our PDFs and our videos were
able to be brought over.

235
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,240
So we didn't have to
recreate 20 classes again.

236
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,700
But a lot of the services and the support

237
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,370
that underlaid that system
is being rebuilt again

238
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,160
from a blank slate because
that could not be reused.

239
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,590
As you go through your organizations,

240
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,520
you need to think about what can I reuse

241
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,890
when I start from where I am

242
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,130
and what do I need to start over on?

243
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,810
That's the guiding principle that we use

244
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,433
as our second guiding principle.
