1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:03,270
- Service Catalog Management.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,740
This is another one that you don't need

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,290
to know for the foundation level,

4
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,360
but we're going to cover it briefly here.

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,910
The practice of providing a single source

6
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,240
of consistent information
on all of your services

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,910
and all of your service offerings

8
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,230
and insuring that's available
to the relevant audience,

9
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,040
is what's known as Service
Catalog Management.

10
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,260
So, for example, if
you come to my website,

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,210
you can see our service catalog.

12
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,760
You're a relevant audience.

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,930
You're going to see all of
the different courses we have

14
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,570
and the different types
of practice exams and labs

15
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,350
and the different types of video courses.

16
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,940
All of that is shown as
part of our service catalog

17
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,570
and you can make a choice based on that,

18
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,230
of which offerings you want to use

19
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,190
and which ones are relevant for you.

20
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,500
Now, if I was running a
large IT organization,

21
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,020
I would have a lot of different
things in my service catalog

22
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,630
I might have a desk top component,

23
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,340
I might have a laptop component,

24
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,430
I might have the fact that
I need a mobile component

25
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,510
like a smart phone.

26
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,377
You could go into the
service catalog and say,

27
00:00:53,377 --> 00:00:56,190
"I need one iPhone that gives
me X amount of band width

28
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,130
and X amount of service
so I can do these things."

29
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,990
You can order that from
the Service Catalog

30
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,540
based on that particular service offering.

31
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,110
As you go and look at any
IT company you deal with,

32
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,930
I want you to look at
what offerings they have.

33
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,080
You're going to see that this
Service Catalog Management

34
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,610
is what's at the heart of it.

35
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,530
This is where we're going to say,

36
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,770
we're bringing on a
new product next month.

37
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,630
We'll list it in the catalog
now, so you know it's coming

38
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,300
or we're going to retire
this product next month.

39
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,860
We're going to list that now
that this is ending soon.

40
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,830
So, if you want to order
it, you better get it now

41
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,840
because it's going away in three months.

42
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,440
This is the idea here when you talk about

43
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,740
Service Catalog Management.

44
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,740
Telling people what is coming,
what is being taken away

45
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,340
and what is currently available.
