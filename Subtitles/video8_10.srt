1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,750
- Organizational change management,

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,760
this is our next practice, and again,

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,740
it's for general
awareness, not on the exam.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,920
Organizational change
management is the practice

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,180
of ensuring that changes
in an organization

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,660
are smoothly and successfully implemented,

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,830
and that lasting benefits are achieved

8
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,650
by managing the human aspects of changes.

9
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,610
Now, this is different
from change management

10
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,960
you may have dealt with
in the technical world.

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,420
In the technical world,
maybe I want to make a change

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,750
to the baseline, I want
to take this server

13
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,640
and I want to add an
additional hard drive.

14
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,840
That would be change management,

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,850
but it's not organizational
change management.

16
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,350
Instead, we find organizational
change management

17
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,720
often occurs as part
of process improvements

18
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,080
and continual improvement processes.

19
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,530
Now, if I'm going to go through
and change the processes

20
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,380
of how we do things, or the
way we conduct business,

21
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,870
I have to help change the
culture and the acceptance

22
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,650
across that culture,
within the organization.

23
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,120
This is why it's important to manage

24
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,150
that human aspect of changes.

25
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,660
We want to make sure that we're
getting the humans involved

26
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,150
so that they can change things,

27
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,600
and that those changes are long-lasting.

28
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,210
That's what organizational
change management is all about.

29
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,160
It's how I keep the momentum going,

30
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,150
when I'm dealing with a
continual improvement,

31
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,760
because without that change of the person,

32
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,010
those changes are going to be short-lived,

33
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,140
so we have to change the
organizational culture

34
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:18,973
along with it,

35
00:01:18,973 --> 00:01:20,770
and that's what organizational
change management

36
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:21,963
is really focused on.
