1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,100
- Focus on value.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,270
Focus on value is our
first guiding principle.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,730
It states that everything
the organization does

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,170
should link back, directly or indirectly,

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,420
to value for itself, its
customers, and its stakeholders.

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,330
Now how do we apply this focus on value?

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,810
Well there's really a four
step method that I like to use

8
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,850
when I think about focusing on value.

9
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,440
First, I want to understand and
identify the service consumer.

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,190
Who is it that I'm trying to serve,

11
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,620
because if you remember from value,

12
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,250
we're trying to co-create value

13
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,200
between the service provider
and the service consumer.

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,950
Now once I identify who
that service consumer is

15
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,010
and how they plan on using my service,

16
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,220
I can then understand the
consumer's perspective of value.

17
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,920
For example, if my service
consumer is a student

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,610
who wants to be able to watch videos

19
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,860
to learn how to pass the ITIL four exam,

20
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,780
then I need to understand how
you plan on consuming that.

21
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,830
Are you planning on sitting
at your desktop all day,

22
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,540
or are you going to be on a mobile device?

23
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,820
And if you're on a mobile device,

24
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,930
do you have enough data to
be able to stream the videos,

25
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,680
or do you want to be
able to download the data

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,960
and be able to download all
those videos ahead of time?

27
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,490
These are all things
that we have to consider

28
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,910
as we're building out our service

29
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,440
and how we can best
support and provide value

30
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,350
to our service consumers.

31
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,580
Then I want to map the value
to the intended outcomes,

32
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,320
and those intended outcomes
may change over time.

33
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,800
I used the example before of this exam.

34
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,670
You're taking this course
so you can pass an exam.

35
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,670
Now once you've passed the exam,

36
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,810
you may go back and
watch these videos again,

37
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,170
but now you have a completely
different perspective

38
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,390
and desired outcome,

39
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,090
because you're not
trying to pass the exam,

40
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,300
you've already done that.

41
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,350
Instead, you're trying
to go back and review

42
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,200
and get smarter in certain areas

43
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,250
so you may be able to take that

44
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,420
and apply it inside your organization.

45
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,750
So those give us two
distinctly different outcomes.

46
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,730
One is a set of students
who are watching the videos

47
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,140
to pass the exam.

48
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,630
Another set is students
who are watching the videos

49
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,870
to get better at their job

50
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,450
and be able to apply ITIL four
inside their organizations.

51
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,170
And that brings us to our fourth step,

52
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,480
and the fourth thing I look at

53
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,570
is to understand the customer experience

54
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,370
and the user experience.

55
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,670
Now this goes back to again,

56
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,130
how does that customer use your service,

57
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,810
what are they trying to achieve in it,

58
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,580
and are you doing it the
best way possible for them?

59
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,650
For example, we might
decide to make a mobile app

60
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,900
that will allow you to take
all of your videos on the go

61
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,690
on your iPhone or your Android.

62
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,370
That might work well if
a lot of my customers

63
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,760
consume our content
through a mobile device,

64
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,140
but if we find that most of our consumers

65
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,570
are consuming that content

66
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,520
by sitting at a desktop or a laptop,

67
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,650
then spending money to build
an Android or an iPhone app

68
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,230
is not going to be worthwhile, right,

69
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,240
and so there's not a lot of value there.

70
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,880
So that's the idea as we go
through those four steps.

71
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,480
Now when we look at application,

72
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,930
there's a couple of key factors.

73
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,420
You want to know how your customers

74
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,370
are going to use each service.

75
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,190
You also want to
encourage a focus on value

76
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,870
among your entire staff,

77
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,510
because as your company
and organization grows,

78
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,360
you're going to have different
people servicing your consumers.

79
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,840
That might be tech support,

80
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,390
it might be customer service agents,

81
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,970
it might be sales agents,

82
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,620
it might be business managers,

83
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,630
whatever it is,

84
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,020
the entire staff needs to know

85
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,620
what that value is that we're
trying to get to our consumers

86
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,570
and then we can push that
across the entire staff

87
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,170
as our leading vision.

88
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,990
Also, when we focus on value,

89
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,810
we want to do this during
operational activity

90
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,120
as well as during our
improvement initiatives.

91
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,820
Focusing on value is done every single day

92
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,410
across the entire service,

93
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,920
whether it's to make it work today

94
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,570
or how we can improve it
to make it better tomorrow.

95
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,700
And finally, I want to make
sure that you're thinking

96
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,230
about creating a focus on value

97
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,250
in every step of any
improvement initiative.

98
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,730
If I decide to go back
and refilm this course,

99
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,630
I need to figure out what
parts need to be improved upon,

100
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,520
and I do that by thinking about the value

101
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,200
it's going to create for
my consumer, my students.

102
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,300
If I'm going to go back
and rerecord this lecture,

103
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,490
I need to be adding something new to it

104
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,530
that makes it better,

105
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,450
and helps you understand
the concepts better,

106
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,000
and allows you to get
more value out of it.

107
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,160
That's the idea.

108
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,810
Everything we do is focused on value,

109
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,010
both for our consumer as well as for us,

110
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,123
the service provider.
