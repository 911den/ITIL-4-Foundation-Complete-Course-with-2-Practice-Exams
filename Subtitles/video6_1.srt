00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:02,470
- Welcome to this section of the course

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:04,670
on the Service Value Chain.

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,110
In this section of the course,

4
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,170
we're going to be focusing

5
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,380
on the fifth major objective for the exam.

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,170
This states that you have
to be able to understand

7
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,010
the activities of the Service Value Chain,

8
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,800
and how they interconnect.

9
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,950
Underneath this objective,

10
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,910
there are two sub-objectives.

11
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,840
It's to describe the interconnected nature

12
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,050
of the Service Value Chain

13
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,420
and how this supports value streams,

14
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,920
and to describe the purpose

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,100
of each of the value stream activities.

16
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,400
That includes Plan,

17
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,233
Improve,

18
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:31,090
Engage,

19
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,360
Design and Transition,

20
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,530
Obtain and Build

21
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,380
and Delivery and Support.

22
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,010
So back when we talked about
the Service Value System,

23
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,200
we had one inside block

24
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,920
that showed us the service value chain.

25
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,670
Well, in this section of the course,

26
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,690
we're going to break that block open,

27
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,840
and look at all of those different pieces.

28
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,890
As you can see here,

29
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:50,723
we have things

30
00:00:50,723 --> 00:00:51,670
like Engage,

31
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,503
Plan,

32
00:00:52,503 --> 00:00:53,400
Improve,

33
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,650
Design and Transition,

34
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:55,680
Obtain and Build,

35
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,770
Deliver and Support

36
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,380
and Products and Services.

37
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,150
And all of those are
going to work together

38
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,450
as part of this service value chain.

39
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,490
Now, there's a couple of
important things to know

40
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:06,530
when we look at a diagram like this.

41
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,330
This is not shown to introduce
a linear sequence of events.

42
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,570
If you happen to be familiar
with ITIL version three

43
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,070
or the older version of ITIL,

44
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,640
we had what we called
the service lifecycle,

45
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,890
And it was a sequence of
actions in a linear format.

46
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,290
So we would start with a strategy,

47
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,390
and then move to design,

48
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,690
and then move to transition,

49
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,350
and then move to operations,

50
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,800
and then we move to continual
service improvement.

51
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,140
And we work through
those five life cycles.

52
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,710
Here in ITIL 4 we don't do that anymore.

53
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,620
This is not a linear sequence.

54
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,270
Instead we normally are
going to start with Engage,

55
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,720
but we don't always have to.

56
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,840
And based on that we're
then going to touch

57
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,800
into other areas of that interior cube.

58
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,430
And as we look at that central cube

59
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,890
with the activities that are in there,

60
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,770
we have three major groups.

61
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,440
We have Design and Transition,

62
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,360
Obtain and Build,

63
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,070
and Deliver and Support.

64
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,200
These are what are referred to

65
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,860
as the central activities
inside the service value chain.

66
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,100
And these can interact in any order

67
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,600
between each other and with
the other activities as well.

68
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,970
Another important thing to know,

69
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,215
is this overlap that
exists between Improve

70
00:02:07,215 --> 00:02:10,400
and the other areas of
the service value chain.

71
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,453
You'll notice that Improve is shown

72
00:02:11,453 --> 00:02:13,540
in the lower half of this diagram.

73
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,920
And here's this overlap
of this purple band

74
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,560
that goes from Improve
to Improve and Engage.

75
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,420
You have Improve to the activities
inside the central cube,

76
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,120
such as the Deliver and Support,

77
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,490
the Design and Transition
or the Obtain and Build.

78
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,210
We have Improve in the
Products and Services.

79
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,910
All of these are here to
show us that feedback loop

80
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,060
that exists between each part
of the service value chain

81
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,060
as it moves through the improvement cycle

82
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,420
and the continual service improvement.

83
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,700
Now you also need to understand and manage

84
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,770
the perceived value of
this service value chain,

85
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,590
because it's going to drive
the demand for the next order,

86
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,520
the next product,

87
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,570
the next service

88
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,000
or the next iteration of
your service relationship.

89
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,810
Now the reason why we call
this a service value chain,

90
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,350
is because all these
actions are linked together.

91
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,360
So there's a lot of
interactions that occur

92
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,230
between these different practices.

93
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,700
This service value chain
activities are going to represent

94
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,750
all of the different steps
that the organization

95
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,160
is going to take in the creation
or co creation of value.

96
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,850
Each activity is going to
contribute to the value chain

97
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,650
by transforming this specific
inputs into desired outputs.

98
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,230
And so as we take things
from demanding opportunity,

99
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,320
it goes through that service value chain,

100
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,150
getting additional value added

101
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,690
in coming out the other side

102
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,100
as the value and the desired outcome

103
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,140
that we want for our services.

104
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,060
That's the way that we're going
to be looking at all of this.

105
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,470
And so to convert these
inputs into outputs,

106
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,860
these value chain activities

107
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,670
are going to use different combinations

108
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,640
of the 34 ITIL practices that
we're going to to discuss

109
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,730
throughout the remainder of this course.

110
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,140
Each activity can draw upon internal

111
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,790
or third party resources.

112
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,450
They can look at different processes,

113
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,270
different skills and competencies,

114
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,330
from one or more of these 34 practices.

115
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,870
They don't have to be done individually.

116
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,720
They can be combined together too.

117
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,010
And that's the whole idea here.

118
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,000
As we start getting
these inner relationships

119
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,650
through the service
value chain activities.

120
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,130
All of the incoming and
outgoing interactions

121
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,530
with all of the different parties

122
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,420
that are external to
your service provider,

123
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,880
are all performed through the
Engage value chain activity.

124
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,870
That's why it's one of those first ones

125
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,560
that normally occurs.

126
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,160
Anytime you want to new resource,

127
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,210
that's going to be obtained

128
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,680
through the Obtain and Build activity.

129
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,180
Anytime you want to plan something.

130
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,040
Any planning is going to occur
through the Plan activity.

131
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,300
When you try to improve things,

132
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,470
that's going to happen
through the Improve activity.

133
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,480
You're kind of getting
the idea here, right?

134
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,310
All of the different things that we do,

135
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,290
are going to be bend into one or more

136
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,720
of these different buckets.

137
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,270
As we create and modify,

138
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,570
and deliver and maintain,

139
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,890
and support a component,

140
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,420
a product or a service,

141
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,990
all that's going to happen
inside that central cube.

142
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,610
Between Design and Transition,

143
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,410
Obtain and Build and Delivery and Support.

144
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,020
As we look at our products and services,

145
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,660
our demand and our value,

146
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,550
these are not considered
value chain activities, right?

147
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,100
Those go back to our service value system.

148
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,260
Those are our inputs and our outputs.

149
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,670
So the inside is what we're
really looking at here.

150
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,840
That's Engage,

151
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,750
Plan,

152
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,720
Improve,

153
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,770
Obtain/build,

154
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,040
Delivery and Support

155
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,640
and Design and Transition.

156
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,810
As we look at those,

157
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,530
that is what we're going to be focusing on

158
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,650
in this section of the course
and we're going to dive

159
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,280
into each one of those in
their own separate lecture,

160
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,363
as we move forward.
