1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,180
- Change Control.

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,910
In this lesson, we're going to talk about

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,610
the Change Control practice.

4
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,250
Now, for the exam, this is one

5
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,150
of the ones you need to know in depth.

6
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,250
You need to be able to recall it's

7
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,060
definition and purpose, as well as

8
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,780
terms associated with
it, and how it operates.

9
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,520
So, let's get started.

10
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,700
The purpose of the Change Control practice

11
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,634
is to maximize the number of successful

12
00:00:20,634 --> 00:00:23,050
IT changes by ensuring that the risks

13
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,485
have been properly assessed, authorizing

14
00:00:24,485 --> 00:00:28,365
changes to proceed, and
managing the change schedule.

15
00:00:28,365 --> 00:00:31,020
Basically, Change Control is what

16
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,740
we used to call Change Management.

17
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,530
It's all about making sure that

18
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,980
before we make a change,
we understand the risk,

19
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,730
we know who's approved it, and

20
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,640
we manage it on the schedule.

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,360
So, when we do this, this
is all a balancing act.

22
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,220
We want to balance the
beneficial effect of changes

23
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,810
against protecting ourself from

24
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,770
adverse effects of changes.

25
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,350
Just think about it this way,

26
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,870
every time you change something,

27
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,920
you're introducing a risk of failure,

28
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,769
and so the change has to be worth while.

29
00:00:56,769 --> 00:01:00,030
We like thing that are
stable and working properly,

30
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,380
but we also like new features and value.

31
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,020
And so, a lot of times
we have to make changes,

32
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,370
but that's going to effect
the stability of the system.

33
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,730
And so, we want to be
able to manage that risk

34
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,000
using risk management, as
well as this Change Control.

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,530
Now, the scope of Change Control

36
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,560
is defined by each organization.

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,030
This is something that
is going to be decided

38
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,780
by your governance, your policies,

39
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,630
and your procedures within
your particular company.

40
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,180
It's going to include all
of the IT infrastructure,

41
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,430
the applications, the documentation,

42
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,950
the processes, the supplier relationships,

43
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,670
and anything else that might directly

44
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,160
or indirectly impact a product or service

45
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,770
that we're going to change.

46
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,560
Now, I mentioned there were seven terms

47
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,200
that you had to learn definitions of

48
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,970
during the study of our practices.

49
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,640
Well, here's the first one.

50
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,470
It's called a change.

51
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,160
Now, a change is the
addition, modification,

52
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,260
or removal of anything that could have

53
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,650
a direct or indirect
effect on IT services.

54
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,483
There's actually three
different types of changes.

55
00:01:54,483 --> 00:01:58,127
There's standard, normal,
and emergency changes.

56
00:01:58,127 --> 00:02:01,040
A standard change is something
that is preauthorized.

57
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,240
It's something that we can implement

58
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,150
without additional authorization.

59
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,600
This is because it's something
we do all of the time,

60
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,170
the risks are well understood, and

61
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,220
therefore it's going to be low risk.

62
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,510
A good example of this would be

63
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,270
if somebody calls up and
asks to reset their password.

64
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,110
That is something that
a service desk analyst

65
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,670
can do on their own, they don't need

66
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,900
any kind of approval, because

67
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,810
it's already been preauthorized.

68
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,543
This is a simple, well understood change,

69
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:25,145
but it is still a change to the system.

70
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,710
Our second type of change is
what we call a normal change.

71
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,470
These are changes where authorization

72
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,090
is going to have to be gained, but

73
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,530
that level of authorization is

74
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,750
going to be based on the different

75
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,050
types of change and how risky it is.

76
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,430
So, if this was a low
or a medium risk thing,

77
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,240
but we don't consider
it a standard change,

78
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,270
it's going to go through
the normal process,

79
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,700
and the person who approves it

80
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,870
is called a Change Authority.

81
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,810
If it's going to be something that is

82
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,950
low or medium risk, that Change Authority

83
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,360
might be your supervisor or their boss.

84
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,638
But if you have a major change,

85
00:02:53,638 --> 00:02:56,340
this might be something
that is really complex,

86
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,270
it's going to need a
higher level of approval,

87
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,820
and it's going to go all the way up

88
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,140
until we get a very
senior Change Authority.

89
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,680
Again, this is going to depend on

90
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,260
how your organization does it,

91
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,940
how much tolerance they have to risk,

92
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,820
and how they want to set it up.

93
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,920
Let me give you an example
of a normal change.

94
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,720
Let's just say, you wanted
to upgrade your server

95
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,672
from Windows 2012 to Windows 2019.

96
00:03:15,672 --> 00:03:18,800
This is a major change,
so we want to make sure

97
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,470
we properly plan for that change.

98
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,650
We want to make sure we get the necessary

99
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,260
coordination done ahead of time,

100
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,490
and we want to make sure all the

101
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,710
right approvals have been done

102
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,100
before we ever attempt to install

103
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,710
that new server software.

104
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,950
That's the idea here with a normal change.

105
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,780
We're going to schedule it, and plan it,

106
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,960
we're going to go and
get a down time for it,

107
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,130
and we're going to do that change

108
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,720
and make sure it all worked properly.

109
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,080
We've got time, we're not in a rush.

110
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,360
Now, sometimes though, we are in a rush,

111
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,850
and this is when things
come up like an emergency.

112
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,940
And so, we have emergency changes.

113
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,800
These are going to be expedited,
and their going to have

114
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,620
an expedited assessment
and authority process.

115
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,870
It may be that there's a
separate change authority

116
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,010
for something that is an emergency.

117
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,550
For example, I used to
work as an IT Director,

118
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,100
and normally for a big change,

119
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,853
I had to go up to my boss who is the CIO,

120
00:04:02,853 --> 00:04:06,360
but if it was an emergency,
I was the Change Authority

121
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,470
and I had permission
to make those changes.

122
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,250
So, I might get a call
at 2:30 in the morning

123
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,670
on a Saturday, and they'd say

124
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,410
that our file server just crashed.

125
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,150
The hard drives in it are completely dead

126
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,210
and they need to be replaced with

127
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,160
spares from a backup server, and

128
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,410
while we're doing that we need to

129
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,180
change some of the configurations.

130
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,300
Well, this is going to
constitute a change,

131
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,660
but we don't have time to go through

132
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,870
all the necessary paperwork of
a normal change requirement.

133
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,330
So, instead, we're going to go through

134
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,550
an Emergency Change Advisory Board.

135
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,080
We're going to get people together,

136
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,100
quickly decide on how risky it is,

137
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,130
do our assessment, and either approve

138
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,440
or disapprove this
because it's an emergency.

139
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,370
We need to get this server back up.

140
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,480
Then, when we come back
in on Monday morning,

141
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,850
we can worry about going back and

142
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,130
doing all the normal change
requirement paperwork,

143
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,860
and going through the regular processes

144
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,460
to make sure everything has
gotten updated in the system.

145
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,620
That's the difference.

146
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,020
An emergency is when you're really

147
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,740
trying to get something
back online quickly,

148
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,220
because something is broke and

149
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,560
it needs to be gotten up right now.

150
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,546
A lot of organizations
will use their emergency

151
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:04,370
as something as a normal way of business.

152
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,530
You don't want to do this.

153
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,410
And what I mean by this is, just because

154
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,360
somebody wants the change done today,

155
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,680
doesn't mean that it's
necessarily an emergency.

156
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,515
It may be they just forgot to plan.

157
00:05:13,515 --> 00:05:15,080
So, you have to think about what

158
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,870
really is an emergency
versus what is normal

159
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,700
and should go through the normal process.

160
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,920
If something is broken and you need

161
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,310
to get the server back online,

162
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,196
that's usually going to be an emergency.

163
00:05:24,196 --> 00:05:26,650
Now, as I said, the person or group who

164
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,960
authorizes the change is what
we call a Change Authority.

165
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,980
In very fast moving organizations,

166
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,000
it's common to have this decentralized,

167
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,270
and we might have many
different Change Authorities

168
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,810
depending on what's going on.

169
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,950
In fact, if you're doing
software development,

170
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,220
your Change Authority might be

171
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,540
the person sitting next to you.

172
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,060
It might be that you review their code

173
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,330
and approve it and they approve your code.

174
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,890
But in big organizations, a lot of times

175
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,660
we want to do things much more formally,

176
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,560
and we'll go through this
normal change process,

177
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,220
and have a formalized Change Authority.

178
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,090
Now, once something has been approved from

179
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,920
the Change Authority, it goes
on to the Change Schedule.

180
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,440
The Change Schedule is used to help us

181
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,260
plan those changes, assist
in communicating that,

182
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,468
and helping to avoid conflicts

183
00:06:05,468 --> 00:06:07,950
and assign proper resources to it.

184
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,560
Let me give you a good example of this.

185
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,690
This weekend, I want to upgrade my website

186
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,400
and we're going to be down for an hour

187
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,970
while we change servers.

188
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:15,970
That's something that I'm going to

189
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,360
email out ahead of time
to all of my students,

190
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,812
so they know this Friday
if they try to log on,

191
00:06:20,812 --> 00:06:23,200
they're not going to be
able to for that hour.

192
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,220
That's the idea of having
a Change Schedule in place.

193
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,570
We already know what's going to happen,

194
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,360
we can tell you weeks in advance,

195
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,950
and that way everybody knows.

196
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,560
It's well coordinated, well
planned, and well communicated.

197
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,330
And by doing that, I can make sure

198
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,770
I have my top level guys sitting there,

199
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,610
ready to go when we make this change.

200
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,410
So, if anything goes wrong, we have

201
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,750
the A list people there who
can fix it and make it right.

202
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,120
So, when we talk about
all of this change stuff,

203
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,980
it does effect different parts of

204
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,580
our Value Change activities.

205
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,120
For example, we have a part in Plan.

206
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,040
Changes for our products
and service portfolio,

207
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,158
our policies, and practices all require

208
00:06:58,158 --> 00:07:00,171
some ammount of control and planning.

209
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:02,730
And so, Plan is going
to help us with that.

210
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,840
We also have a lot of
improvement initiatives, right.

211
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,530
And when we go through
improvement initiatives,

212
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,030
those are going to have to
have to be changes made.

213
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,340
For example, if I want to move from

214
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,050
an older server to a new
server, that's a change.

215
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,960
And so, we're going to
use the Change Control

216
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,083
as part of the Improve activity, as well.

217
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,490
When we talk about Engage, our customers

218
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,550
and our users need to know what
kind of changes are coming,

219
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,380
when down times are, and they should

220
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,790
be able to expect the
nature of that change.

221
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,290
Again, by communicating
this, we're engaging

222
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,560
with our customers, so we're going to

223
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,620
use that Engage activity.

224
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,680
Then, if we look in our
Design and Transition,

225
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,080
these changes are all designed

226
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,870
and initiated somewhere, right?

227
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,920
Usually in Design, and then Transition.

228
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,510
Once we approve a change it goes

229
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:45,260
into transition to be made into a reality

230
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,150
and put into our real network.

231
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,320
Now, this is where the
Change Control activity

232
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,010
is a major contributor
into the transition phase.

233
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,280
Then, we're going to obtain
and build things, right?

234
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,550
Anytime I want to change something,

235
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,400
it means I'm probably
buying something new,

236
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,670
whether it's software, or it's hardware,

237
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,070
or I'm building some kind
of custom software in house,

238
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,410
all of that goes on in the Obtain/Build.

239
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,510
Once it's ready, it's going to be an input

240
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,480
into this Change Control practice,

241
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,660
so that we can get it approved

242
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,170
and transitioned onto the real servers.

243
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,480
And then, finally, Deliver and Support.

244
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,740
Changes can have an impact
on Deliver and Support.

245
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,470
They can have a huge impact there,

246
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,160
because if I put a new server on

247
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,640
that changes the way they
have to do their processes,

248
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,540
that changes the way
they do their procedures.

249
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,490
All that stuff is going to be changed.

250
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,870
We also want to make
sure we are communicating

251
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,180
the changes both to our users, but also

252
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,690
to the personnel who have
to support those users.

253
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,070
If I don't tell the Service Agents

254
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,600
that we went from server
2012 to server 2019,

255
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,330
and they now have to support 2019

256
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,700
without any training,
that's not going to be good.

257
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,040
So, change is going to make sure that

258
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,060
we're thinking about those
type of things, as well.

259
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,630
We want to make sure everybody
knows what change is coming,

260
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,393
and we communicate that
well so everyone is ready.
