1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,650
- Strategy management,
this is another practice

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:04,680
for your general knowledge,

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,770
and it's not covered by the exam.

4
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:09,730
Strategy management is the
practice of formulating the goals

5
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,500
of an organization, and
adopting the courses of action

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,740
and allocation of resources necessary

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,550
for achieving those goals.

8
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,420
Strategy management is simply responsible

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,680
for establishing the
organization's direction,

10
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,620
focusing our effort to finding

11
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,920
and clarifying our
organizational priorities,

12
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,810
and providing consistency or guidance

13
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,470
in response to the environment.

14
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,620
Normally, strategy management
is going to be done

15
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,940
at very high levels in your organization.

16
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,170
You're going to get
direction from the CEO,

17
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,300
as well as the other C-Suite executives,

18
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,800
on which way the
organization should be going.

19
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,250
And they're going to do this
based on the changing environment

20
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,690
that they see outside of the organization.

21
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,160
For example, let's go
back to the early 2000s

22
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,430
and think about the company called Kodak.

23
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,210
Kodak was a film company,
and around the early 2000s,

24
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,010
digital cameras were
starting to outpace the way

25
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,450
that traditional film
companies were operating,

26
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,780
because most people were moving

27
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,450
from a regular camera to a digital camera.

28
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,840
Well, if you think about
it nowadays, here in 2019,

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,900
how many people have
a film camera anymore?

30
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,490
Almost nobody, right?

31
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,500
Well, that would put
Kodak out of business,

32
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,670
because their major
profit center was film.

33
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,760
And so, what they had to
start doing was figuring out,

34
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,960
with their strategy, should they pivot?

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,120
Should they move from
film to digital cameras?

36
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,310
And they tried to do that,

37
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,910
but they did it a little bit too late.

38
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,800
And so, they didn't
really get enough of a go,

39
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,960
and that company ended up not
doing well in the long-term.

40
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,170
The reason for this was
they didn't see the writing

41
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,340
on the wall, they didn't
pivot quick enough

42
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,590
because their strategy
didn't change quick enough.

43
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,000
Strategy management is
focused on doing that.

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,100
It's being able to see what the future is

45
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,520
and turning the organization
before that future hits you.

46
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,020
That's the whole goal here.

47
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,720
We want to be able to focus our effort

48
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,470
to find our organizational priorities

49
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,470
and make sure that we're all
aiming towards the same vision.
