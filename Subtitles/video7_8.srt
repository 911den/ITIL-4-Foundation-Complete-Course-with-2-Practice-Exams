1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,700
- Did we get there?

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,500
We have come a long way in
our improvement journey.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,530
For us, it may have been
10 or 20 minutes of video,

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,630
but in real life, we may
have just spent three

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,000
to six months to create and
implement the improvement

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,320
we wanted to see.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,440
Now it's time to check in on our progress

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,080
and see if we made a positive
or a negative change.

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,670
The sixth step, did we get there,

10
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,690
involves checking our new normal.

11
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,450
Basically, where are we today,

12
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,460
and comparing it against
the original baseline

13
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,090
from step two that we took at
the beginning of the process.

14
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,682
Too often, once an improvement
plan is set into motion,

15
00:00:33,682 --> 00:00:36,470
people just start to assume
that the expected benefits

16
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,790
are going to be achieved.

17
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,840
They run off and they start
on the next initiative

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,210
and they stop measuring or
worrying about the current one

19
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,340
you're working on.

20
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,540
In the real world though,
the journey to reaching

21
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,480
an improved state is usually
found among the pathway lined

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,290
with a lot of obstacles.

23
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,690
Success is simply not guaranteed.

24
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,400
It must be measured and
it must be validated.

25
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,720
So, in step six, we're going
to take another measurement

26
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,710
just like we did back in step two.

27
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,860
We're going to use the
exact same processes

28
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,975
and then we're going to
compare those two measurements.

29
00:01:04,975 --> 00:01:07,577
Let's go back and use
our college GPA example.

30
00:01:07,577 --> 00:01:11,299
We wanted to reach a 3.3 GPA
by the end of the semester.

31
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:13,580
If we just looked at your report card

32
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,670
and we saw you earned
a 3.4, then we did it!

33
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,900
You've improved your score
and took it up above a 3.3.

34
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,100
That's great.

35
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,470
Now on the other hand,
if you earned a 3.2,

36
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:24,870
we missed the mark.

37
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,870
Based on our new measurements,
we now have a new baseline

38
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,410
and we can determine
what we need to do next.

39
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,630
This is where we pick
up in the next lesson,

40
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,333
the seventh and final step.
