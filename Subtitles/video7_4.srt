1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,170
- Where are We Now?

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,440
The success of an improvement
initiative depends

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,580
on a clear and accurate understanding

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,030
of the starting point and the
impact of your initiative.

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,310
Now, if you think of an
improvement as a journey going

6
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,050
from point A to point B,

7
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,190
this step clearly defines
what point A looks like.

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,590
Think about it like this.

9
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,070
If I asked you to drive
to my office right now,

10
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,190
you'd first need to know two things.

11
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,400
First, you need to know
where my office is,

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,990
and I'm located in the Washington DC area,

13
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,440
and second, you need to know

14
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,980
where you are currently located.

15
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,330
If you're in California,

16
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,680
you're going to need to get in your car

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,210
and drive east to reach my office,

18
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,600
but if you're sitting in London,

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,690
England, you're going to
need to charter a boat

20
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,180
or get on a plane and
then start heading west.

21
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,530
Depending on where you're
coming from is going to dictate

22
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,100
where you're going to, and
how you're going to get there.

23
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,920
Your journey simply can't be mapped out

24
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,100
if you don't know what
your starting point is.

25
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,270
Now, in relation to our IT services,

26
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,890
we need to understand the current state

27
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,780
of our services and our products.

28
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,650
To do that, we're going to
conduct a current state assessment

29
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,110
of the existing services

30
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,050
by determining what the user's perception

31
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,850
of the value is for our services,

32
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:07,250
what existing skills and
competencies our workforce

33
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,720
has for our services, and what processes

34
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,660
and procedures are involve
in delivering those services.

35
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,190
We may even look at what the
technical capabilities are

36
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,420
of our current servers, our
networks, and other solutions.

37
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,260
If you're looking at your
organization's ability

38
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,650
to deliver the services,

39
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,970
you're also going to look at
your organization's culture

40
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,900
and the prevailing
attitudes of the employees.

41
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,440
Now, as we do all of this,

42
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,410
we're going to be
conducting this assessment

43
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,960
to determine the current state

44
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,980
using objective measurements
whenever we can.

45
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,270
Now, an objective measurement

46
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,080
is something we can actually measure.

47
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,460
It's not just do I feel good
about this or bad about this?

48
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,530
We're going to try to put numbers to it.

49
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,200
These measurements are going
to be used to create a baseline

50
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,530
and this baseline can
be used in later steps

51
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,250
of the process to compare
our progress against

52
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,660
our current baseline or current state.

53
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,780
Now, remember, it's difficult to track

54
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,260
and measure any effectiveness

55
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,810
of your improvement initiatives
if you never determine

56
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,380
where you started from.

57
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,590
Make sure you take the time

58
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,230
to create a good objective baseline before

59
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,360
you move into the next step

60
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,160
of the continuing improvement model.
