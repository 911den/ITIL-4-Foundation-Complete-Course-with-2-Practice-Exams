1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,120
- Plan.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,620
The first value chain activity
we're going to discuss

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,653
in this section is known as Plan.

4
00:00:06,653 --> 00:00:09,540
The purpose of the Plan
value chain activity

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,340
is to ensure a shared understanding

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,300
of vision, the current status,

7
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,640
and the improvement direction

8
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,720
for all four dimensions of
the IT service management,

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,400
and all of our products and services

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,105
across the organization.

11
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:23,760
This is your executive vision.

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,340
It's where we want to be,

13
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,520
and then the plans to get us there.

14
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,260
As we look at the inputs
to the Plan process,

15
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,890
we're going to be looking at policies,

16
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,370
requirements, and
constraints that are provided

17
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,810
by the organization's governance body.

18
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,340
We're also going to be
looking at consolidating

19
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,220
all of the demands and opportunities

20
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,720
that are being sent to us
from the Engage process

21
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,800
that we're going to be talking
about in a few minutes.

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,970
We're also going to be
looking at all of the

23
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,950
value chain performance information,

24
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,050
the improvement initiatives,

25
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,970
and the plans that are provided
from the Improve process.

26
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,920
We're also going to be looking
at improvement status reports

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,310
from the Improve process.

28
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,250
We're going to be looking
at knowledge and information

29
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,390
about our new and changed proxy services

30
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,150
from our design and transition or

31
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,090
obtain and build processes.

32
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,680
We're going to take that
knowledge and information

33
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,920
about third party service
components as well,

34
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,675
coming in from the Engage process.

35
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:11,830
All of this is things that are
going to go into our planning,

36
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:14,850
so we can figure out how we
can best get our services

37
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,670
to where we want them to be.

38
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,010
If you're familiar with the old ITIL ways,

39
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,870
it used to be known as strategy.

40
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,200
A lot of that is now part
of this Plan process.

41
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,100
Now, all of that is the inputs,

42
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,190
what comes out of the Plan process?

43
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,240
Well, we're going to be looking
at three levels of Plans.

44
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,540
We have strategic plans,

45
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,750
which are those big organizational plans.

46
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,060
We have tactical plans, and
we have operational plans.

47
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,730
And this is kind of big, middle, and small

48
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,810
as we get down into the weeds.

49
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,000
We also have portfolio decisions
that are going to be made,

50
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,160
so we can decide what services
are we going to bring online

51
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,750
so that we can pass those
to Design and Transition,

52
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,340
so they can actually design
and build those services,

53
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,480
and figure out how to make them a reality.

54
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,060
When we talk about Plan,
we're talking about

55
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,530
the big, overarching way of thinking about

56
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,150
how we're going to get somewhere.

57
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,000
We also want to think about

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,810
our architectures and our policies,

59
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,370
and those are things that
we're going to output

60
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,300
and give to Design and Transition.

61
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,349
Now what do I mean by
architectures and policies?

62
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:11,430
Well, maybe part of our plan means

63
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,710
that we're going to use
cloud architectures.

64
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,830
That means the Design
and Transition should

65
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,340
no longer be trying to build
server farms for us to use.

66
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,490
Instead, they should be
looking at getting things

67
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,899
on the Amazon Web Services,

68
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:25,860
or Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud.

69
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,580
That would be an architecture decision

70
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,970
that's going to come out of plans,

71
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,560
and be given to Design and Transition.

72
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,810
As we want to give things
back to the Improve process,

73
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,260
we want to tell them,
based on our planning,

74
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,300
we think these are things
that can be improved,

75
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,240
these are improvement opportunities.

76
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,320
So, we'll pass that back to
the Improve process as well.

77
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,037
Another thing we're going to
give to the Engage process

78
00:02:45,037 --> 00:02:47,960
is our product and our service portfolio.

79
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,910
As an organization, we're
going to create the roadmap

80
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,270
of what we want to build
and what we want to get

81
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,740
over the next, say, three or five years.

82
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,730
Once we have that plan in place,

83
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,876
we give that to Engage,
and they're going to go out

84
00:02:59,876 --> 00:03:02,700
and engage with customers, consumers,

85
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,840
as well as service
providers, to figure out

86
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,640
how we can build what we
want to get from this plan.

87
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,910
And that engagement is
going to happen by going out

88
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,130
and making contracts or making connections

89
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,420
to get what we need.

90
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,779
Which brings us to the last thing.

91
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,830
Engagement also is going
to go out as an output

92
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,180
from our plans and get the contracts

93
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,680
and the agreements in place
so that we can actually

94
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,740
give that into the Design and Transition,

95
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,920
and then to the Build team,

96
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,966
so they can build what
it is we're envisioning.

97
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:30,410
That's the idea.

98
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,600
When you hear about plans
inside the service value chain,

99
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,230
I want you to think
about the fact that we're

100
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,980
thinking about big plans.

101
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,640
We're talking about roadmaps.

102
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,000
For example, in my
company, we have roadmap

103
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,810
that says over the next three years,

104
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,787
these are the different
certification programs

105
00:03:44,787 --> 00:03:48,140
that we're going to support and
create videos and exams for.

106
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,460
If it's not on that roadmap,

107
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,930
we're not going to put effort towards it,

108
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,330
because that is our plan.

109
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,150
That is what we're going
to be going towards.

110
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,570
That is our big, overarching,
strategic vision.

111
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,530
Now, from that strategic vision,

112
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,210
we have a tactical plan
that says in the next year,

113
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,920
we're going to do these
three certifications maybe.

114
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,340
And then we have operational plans

115
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,250
of how we're going to build one
of those individual courses.

116
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,840
So it goes from the big
plan, to a medium sized plan,

117
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,540
down to the very detailed
operational plan.

118
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,480
That's the idea here
when we talk about plans

119
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,263
inside the service value chain.
