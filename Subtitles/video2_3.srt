1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,800
- Organizations and people.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,260
When we discuss the
concept of an organization

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,570
inside of ITIL 4, the
organization is not limited

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,680
to a service provider organization,

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,550
or an internal information
technology organization,

6
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,050
or even an information
technology organization at large.

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,950
Instead, we're just looking at this

8
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,010
as a generic organization.

9
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,850
But, what exactly is
an organization anyway?

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,190
Well ITIL 4 defines an organization

11
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,550
as a person or a group of people that has

12
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,870
its own functions with responsibilities,

13
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,500
authorities, and relationships,
to achieve its objectives.

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,720
Notice this definition is pretty generic,

15
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,340
and again this is done on purpose

16
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,710
by the creators of ITIL,
because it allows ITIL

17
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,190
to be more widely used and
adapted to any organization.

18
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,290
In ITIL 4 there are two basic roles

19
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,310
that an organization can fulfill.

20
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,150
A service provider is a role performed

21
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,350
by an organization in
a service relationship

22
00:00:53,297 --> 00:00:55,070
to provide services to consumers.

23
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,160
Conversely, a consumer is a role performed

24
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,110
by an organization in the relationship

25
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,030
that uses or consumes those services.

26
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,040
Organizations vary in size
and complexity as well.

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,910
Now, organizations can also
vary in their legal structure

28
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,640
in that they can be a single person,

29
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,400
a team, or even a complex
multinational corporation.

30
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,420
What really bounds an
organization together

31
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,050
is a set of common objectives,

32
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,930
relationships, and authorities.

33
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,410
Now, this may seem strange,

34
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,470
especially when
considering a single person

35
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,240
that can act as an organization,

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,820
but it really does work
this way in the real world.

37
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,340
When I created my company,
Dion Training Solutions,

38
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,130
it was created as a sole
proprietorship originally.

39
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,680
I was a single person
operating as an organization

40
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,870
in all of my business relationships.

41
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,130
Now, an organization
can be a team of people

42
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,390
working towards a common objective too.

43
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,910
As my company has gotten bigger,

44
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,220
we now have two teams
of people which make up

45
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,580
two distinct organizations
within the company.

46
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,550
One is the training team, which I lead,

47
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,240
and the other is our operations team,

48
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,120
which my director of operations leads.

49
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,400
Now, the director of operations
happens to be my wife,

50
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,220
but she has her own team
and people who work for her.

51
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,370
This is an example of how people organized

52
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,510
around common goals within a
larger business organization

53
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,520
to achieve common objectives
in a coordinated method.

54
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,310
Now, in most of these cases,

55
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,620
the common objectives are
usually trying to create

56
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,210
value for the consumer, but the way value

57
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,070
is actually achieved
has changed in ITIL 4.

58
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,060
Previously, value was considered something

59
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,040
that was delivered from a service provider

60
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,640
to the consumer of the service.

61
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,240
But this wasn't entirely accurate

62
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,950
the way it was done in the real world.

63
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,667
In fact, it was so
inaccurate that saying like

64
00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:29,227
"Delivering something it easy,

65
00:02:29,227 --> 00:02:31,400
"but delivering something
of value is hard,"

66
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,850
began to spring up all throughout

67
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,020
the IT service management industry.

68
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,640
So instead, ITIL 4 recognizes that value

69
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,380
must be cocreated by the service
provider and the consumer.

70
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,720
Now, what does this mean
for us in the real world?

71
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,970
Well, let's take this
course as an example.

72
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,820
My team and I have spent a lot of time

73
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,300
preparing this course,
filming this course,

74
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,570
editing this course, and
publishing this course

75
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,290
so that you could get value from it.

76
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,320
And I truly believe
this is the best course

77
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,570
that's out there today.

78
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,410
And as such I place a lot of value

79
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,600
on the content, and I hope you do as well.

80
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,810
But, let's look at it from your
perspective as the consumer.

81
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,980
Is this course truly valuable?

82
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,080
Well, you've exchanged some
of your hard earned money

83
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,600
to get access to this training,

84
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,110
so you probably feel that
it has some amount of value

85
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,710
or you wouldn't have given me your money

86
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,310
to access this course.

87
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,720
Now if you're like most students,

88
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,280
you probably are going to measure this

89
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,190
based on the fact of seeing if it actually

90
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,870
prepares you to pass the foundation exam.

91
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,160
But, for you to achieve
that desired value,

92
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,880
passing the exam, we have to
co-create that value together.

93
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,630
As the supplier, I've provided
you with all the videos,

94
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,730
the quizzes, the practice
exam, the web server,

95
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,310
access to the training,
downloadable PDFs, all of that.

96
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,830
But, as the consumer, you have to actually

97
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,370
watch those videos, study the definitions,

98
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,180
practice with the quizzes,
take the practice exam.

99
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,360
Not to mention, you have to have a laptop,

100
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,100
a tablet, or a phone, to
even access these videos

101
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,170
and be able to watch
them, as well as a stable,

102
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,010
high speed internet connection.

103
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,610
To achieve the desired outcome
in value from this course

104
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,990
we both have to work
hard and meet our ends

105
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,380
of this obligation.

106
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,700
That's the idea of co-creation of value.

107
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,200
By the service provider, me and my team

108
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,900
and you the consumer.

109
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,690
This is how it work inside of ITIL 4.

110
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,150
Now, as much as I'd love to be able

111
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,690
to simply create the value for you

112
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,360
as soon as you make the purchase,

113
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,770
we don't have that technology yet

114
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,130
to instantly load up the
information into your head.

115
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,950
This isn't The Matrix after all.

116
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,600
Instead, you have to have to help me

117
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,330
to create the value we both want,

118
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,450
which is for you to pass
your certification exam

119
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,790
on the first attempt.

120
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,930
As the supplier, I can try really hard

121
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,690
to deliver that value,
but if you as the consumer

122
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,770
don't actually cooperate
and turn on the videos

123
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,250
and watch them, well then the value simply

124
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,320
won't be created because
the value is the outcome.

125
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,730
It's you getting that certification done.

126
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,400
This is why relationships
between organizations

127
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,210
such as the supplier and the consumer

128
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,080
have become very complex.

129
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,930
In the simplest form, the provider would

130
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,750
deliver a service, the consumer
would pay for the service,

131
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,430
and the provider then uses that money

132
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,490
to create more services,
while the consumer

133
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,530
uses the current service they paid for.

134
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,820
Now, if both sides are
getting the value they desire

135
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,940
from that transaction, then
this is mutually beneficial.

136
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,570
If the value is not achieved by either

137
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,350
of these sides though, then it's likely

138
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,600
that this relationship
will soon come to an end,

139
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,000
and no more value will emerge from it.

140
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,960
Unfortunately, the real
world is much more complex

141
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,830
than the simple example of
value creation I just gave.

142
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,907
At any moment an organization
can be a consumer

143
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:25,450
and a provider for multiple services.

144
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,510
Let's take my organization for example.

145
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,550
I'm a supplier in relation to you,

146
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,700
but I'm also a consumer in my relationship

147
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,380
with my web hosting provider.

148
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,190
These are just different hats being worn

149
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,810
by my organization, depending
on which perspective

150
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,280
we're looking at things from.

151
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,830
This means that when my organization

152
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,400
is acting as a consumer,
we co-create value

153
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,440
by consuming services, and when
we're acting as a provider,

154
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,810
we co-create value by providing service

155
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,750
to other organizations and people.

156
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,460
Organizations recognize
that value is cocreated

157
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,920
through an active
collaboration between providers

158
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,370
and consumers, as well
as other organizations

159
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,010
that are part of the relevant
service relationships.

160
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,400
These service provider
and service consumer roles

161
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,830
are the two generic roles that
an organization can fulfill.

162
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,220
People though can fulfill
three other types of roles.

163
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,090
This is the role of a user,
a customer, and a sponsor.

164
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,220
The first role is that of a user.

165
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,210
A user is simply a person
who uses a service.

166
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,380
The second role is that of a customer.

167
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,750
A customer is the person
who defines the requirements

168
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,650
for a service, and takes responsibility

169
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,860
for the outcomes of the
service consumption.

170
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,110
The third role is that of a sponsor.

171
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,360
A sponsor is a person
who authorizes the budget

172
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,810
for service consumption.

173
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,620
The term sponsor is also
used in some organizations

174
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,710
to describe an organization or department,

175
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,730
or an individual that provides financial

176
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,930
or other support for an initiative.

177
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,480
While these are the three roles,

178
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,090
these roles could be
fulfilled by different people

179
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,280
or all three of these
roles could be fulfilled

180
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,920
by the same person.

181
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,430
Let's consider a simple
scenario where all three roles

182
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,560
are going to be filled by the same person.

183
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,370
Maybe it's been a few years and you decide

184
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,040
to buy a brand new car.

185
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,410
Let's say you're all excited about

186
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,680
all the technological improvements

187
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,180
that have been made in the world of cars,

188
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,040
and you decide to get one that can perform

189
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,620
semi-autonomous driving, like a Tesla.

190
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,720
As a user, you're really excited to drive

191
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,130
your new Tesla because it
has so many cool features

192
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,390
like the autopilot, the
comfortable leather seats

193
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,450
and a really fast electric motor.

194
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:19,030
As a customer though, you
may not see a big difference

195
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,780
in the features between
a Model S and a Model 3,

196
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,410
so you're trying to decide which model

197
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,510
best meets your requirements
and helps you achieve

198
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,230
your outcomes most efficiently

199
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,610
when you're consuming the service

200
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,550
of this semi autonomous vehicle.

201
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,580
Now in your third role as a sponsor

202
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,530
you start to weigh the cost of the Model 3

203
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,810
versus the Model S, and
you try to determine

204
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,390
which one should you budget for

205
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,180
in order to meet the needs
of your semi-autonomous car

206
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,350
that's going to drive you
from point A to point B

207
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,940
and get you to work each day.

208
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,780
Now, all three of these roles
have competing interests.

209
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,240
The user wants the best features

210
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,640
when they consume the service,

211
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,990
but they'd probably be happy with either

212
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,820
the Model 3 or the Model S.

213
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,910
They're both really nice cars after all.

214
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,620
The customer in you actually defines

215
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,400
the requirements though for your new car.

216
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,930
They define that one has to be able

217
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,780
to drive semi-autonomously.

218
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,830
They want one that can drive

219
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,370
at least 200 miles before
needing to be refueled

220
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,610
or recharged, and other kind
of requirements like that.

221
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,690
Your third role is that of the sponsor,

222
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,580
and this is where things
come from a cost perspective.

223
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,190
While I might like the Model S,

224
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,380
it sells for almost $100,000.

225
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,960
Can the Model 3 still meet all

226
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,050
of the customer's requirements

227
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,450
even though it sells for only 60,000?

228
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,760
Well, if so, then the
sponsor would rather choose

229
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,350
the less expensive option.

230
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,260
So, whenever you buy yourself a new car,

231
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,910
you're really balancing these three roles

232
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,790
before you make the decision,
and you're doing this

233
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,530
all inside your own head.

234
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,430
Now, let's consider a
little bit differently.

235
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,800
Let's say we're going to
buy a car for somebody else.

236
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,360
My daughter is almost to the age

237
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,740
where she's old enough to drive,

238
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,880
and so she's going to be
the user in this scenario

239
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,880
because she wants her parents
to buy her first car for her.

240
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,620
She doesn't care how much it costs.

241
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,857
She doesn't have any requirements.

242
00:08:50,857 --> 00:08:52,300
She just knows that she's
going to consume the resource

243
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,940
and she needs to be
able to get in and drive

244
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,500
from point A to point B.

245
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,520
In this case, this
means that she can drive

246
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,350
wherever she wants, and
she'll be able to drive

247
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,620
whatever her mother and
I decide to buy for her.

248
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,710
Now, my wife on the other hand
is going to be our customer.

249
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,970
She's going to set the
requirements for this service,

250
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,650
the car in our particular example,

251
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,000
and this service is going to
have to meet those requirements,

252
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,870
and she's going to be the
one taking responsibility

253
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,740
for our daughter's actions
when she consumes that service.

254
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,680
In this case, when our daughter is driving

255
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,690
my wife is going to be
responsible for whatever happens

256
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,330
because she is the customer.

257
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,050
Now, my wife may create some
requirements for this new car.

258
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,240
She might say that it
has to have four seats,

259
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,980
that it has to have four doors.

260
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,830
Maybe it has to have a
driver and passenger airbag.

261
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,200
The car might have to be
less than 10 years old.

262
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,250
Whatever the requirements
is that she decides,

263
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,060
she has that ability
because she is the customer.

264
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,090
Now, our third role is the sponsor,

265
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,760
and this is the person who is
going to pay for the initiative.

266
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,700
In this case, the one of
buying a car for my daughter,

267
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,930
I am going to be the sponsor.

268
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,620
I am going to have to pay for this thing.

269
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,200
I have created a budget for this car.

270
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,380
Let's say, no more than $10,000,

271
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,810
and that means the customer, my wife,

272
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,080
can pick any car that
she wants for the user,

273
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,730
my daughter, but this car has to be

274
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,920
within that budget of $10,000.

275
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,760
So, I guess my wife isn't
going to be able to go out

276
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,590
and buy her a brand new car,
even though the customer

277
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,890
may want that, or the user may want that.

278
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,060
Instead, the customer has been allocated

279
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,130
a specific budget, and they
have to stay within that.

280
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,170
So, this is the same type
of thing that happens

281
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,980
in business all of the time.

282
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,700
Sometimes in business you get to act

283
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,900
as one, two, or three of these roles

284
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,500
depending on the scenario.

285
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,610
For example, you may define what is needed

286
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,520
for your business team, and
you may have the authority

287
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,170
to allocate and authorize the budget

288
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,230
for those requirements,
and you're going to be

289
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,510
both the customer and
sponsor in that case.

290
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,830
But, your team members
are going to be the users

291
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,610
because they're going to use what you buy.

292
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,380
This is actually a great position to be in

293
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,110
because the person authorizing the budget

294
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,920
is also the person making
the requirements decisions.

295
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,700
Unfortunately though, in a
lot of large organizations,

296
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,440
the person who authorizes
the budget for an IT service

297
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,030
is not a customer or a
user of that service.

298
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,570
And this type of disconnect
can actually cause problems

299
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,580
because the sponsor who
funds the requirements

300
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,750
and the customer who
creates those requirements

301
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,820
often have arguments over what
those requirements should be.

302
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,140
Because, the sponsor's
focused on the efficiency

303
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,140
and cost savings, whereas the customers

304
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,260
are focused on the
requirements and the users

305
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,770
are focused on the
usability of this service.

306
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,790
This can create a gap between the user

307
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,750
and the customer's interest as well.

308
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,080
As a service provider,
it's our responsibility

309
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,060
to recognize these three generic roles

310
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,880
on a consumer side, and to
work with them appropriately

311
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,800
to ensure the right
service is being delivered

312
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,900
and supplied to meet those needs.

313
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,040
This means we need to
ensure that the financials

314
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,040
work for the sponsor,
that the requirements

315
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,030
are met for the customer, and the users

316
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:35,170
get what they expect in
usability of our service.

317
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,910
At the end of the day, we want to achieve

318
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,280
user satisfaction, customer satisfaction,

319
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,900
and sponsor satisfaction

320
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,910
because when all three come together

321
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,510
we're more likely to have repeat business

322
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,160
from the consumer's organization.
