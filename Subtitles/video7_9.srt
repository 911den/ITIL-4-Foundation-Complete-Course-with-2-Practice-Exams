1
00:00:00,247 --> 00:00:03,070
- Our seventh and final
step is to determine

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,160
how do we keep the momentum going?

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,869
We probably just spent a lot of time,

4
00:00:06,869 --> 00:00:09,154
a lot of money, and a lot of working hours

5
00:00:09,154 --> 00:00:11,668
trying to improve something
in the organization.

6
00:00:11,668 --> 00:00:14,851
If we met the goal, we don't
want to necessarily stop, though,

7
00:00:14,851 --> 00:00:16,701
but we want to keep improving, right?

8
00:00:16,701 --> 00:00:18,349
'Cause we always want to get better.

9
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:19,960
And, if we didn't meet our goal,

10
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,291
then we need to go back
an readjust and figure out

11
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,690
how we can improve to meet our goals.

12
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,440
If this happened, we might
return to an earlier step,

13
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,130
create a new goal, or create
a new plan and then try again.

14
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,890
But let's think positively
for a few minutes here.

15
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,731
Let's assume that we met
our goals that we set out

16
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:38,040
in step three with our
key performance indicators

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,918
and our critical success factors.

18
00:00:39,918 --> 00:00:41,341
Things are going great.

19
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,531
We improved, and everyone is happy.

20
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:45,560
Well, if we don't do something,

21
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,549
oftentimes people are going to revert

22
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:49,261
to their old ways of doing business.

23
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:52,408
For example, maybe our customer
service satisfaction scores

24
00:00:52,408 --> 00:00:54,697
weren't very good, and so we set forth

25
00:00:54,697 --> 00:00:56,967
on an improvement initiative,
and we raised the scores

26
00:00:56,967 --> 00:01:00,023
by 50% and things are going really well.

27
00:01:00,023 --> 00:01:01,967
So we decide to shift our focus

28
00:01:01,967 --> 00:01:04,237
to a new initiative, and now, guess what?

29
00:01:04,237 --> 00:01:06,056
Since nobody's closely monitoring

30
00:01:06,056 --> 00:01:07,986
the customer support metrics anymore,

31
00:01:07,986 --> 00:01:10,800
the call center agents
stop trying as hard,

32
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,367
and the satisfaction scores
start going down again.

33
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:16,347
Now, this is the opposite of what we want.

34
00:01:16,347 --> 00:01:18,807
Or maybe, whenever the
initiative that you did

35
00:01:18,807 --> 00:01:20,826
worked so well within one department

36
00:01:20,826 --> 00:01:23,396
we decided we want to
keep the momentum going

37
00:01:23,396 --> 00:01:26,760
by instituting that change
across multiple departments

38
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,418
by issuing a new company policy.

39
00:01:28,418 --> 00:01:30,490
Either way, we want to make sure

40
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,418
the improvement gains keep going forward

41
00:01:32,418 --> 00:01:34,866
and we keep up with the
progress we're making.

42
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:37,470
This is what step seven is all about.

43
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,057
It's about creating
and implementing a plan

44
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,687
to keep that positive
momentum moving forward

45
00:01:41,687 --> 00:01:45,047
and keeping us to get more
improvements down the road.

46
00:01:45,047 --> 00:01:47,394
And then you're going
to notice in the diagram

47
00:01:47,394 --> 00:01:50,372
that we return to the top
of the model once more.

48
00:01:50,372 --> 00:01:51,383
Why is this?

49
00:01:51,383 --> 00:01:54,717
Well, this is because we
always want to be improving.

50
00:01:54,717 --> 00:01:58,117
This is our goal, constant
and continual improvement.

51
00:01:58,117 --> 00:02:00,690
This model is cyclical in nature.

52
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,378
We continue to go round
and round and round again,

53
00:02:03,378 --> 00:02:05,906
gaining more efficiencies,
more effectiveness,

54
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:07,985
and more value as we go along.

55
00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:09,837
That's the whole goal here inside

56
00:02:09,837 --> 00:02:11,426
the continual improvement model.

57
00:02:11,426 --> 00:02:14,283
We want to keep improving always.
