1
00:00:00,498 --> 00:00:02,570
- IT Asset Management.

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,750
In this lesson, we're going
to talk about the practice

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,370
of IT Asset Management.

4
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:07,840
And this starts the
ones that we're going to

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,720
talk about from the recall only.

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,330
So what you need to know from this lesson

7
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,060
is really to memorize the
purpose of IT Asset Management.

8
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:18,120
And that is to plan and
manage the full life cycle

9
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,340
of IT assets.

10
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,770
To help the organization
maximize value, control costs,

11
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,860
manage risks, support
decision-making about purchases,

12
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,880
re-use and retirement of
assets, and meet the regulatory

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,020
and contractual obligations.

14
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,340
But in addition to memorizing
that purpose, you also need

15
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,160
to memorize the term IT Asset
that was used in that purpose.

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,770
What's an IT Asset?

17
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,940
Well, an IT Asset is
any valuable component

18
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,620
that can contribute to the delivery

19
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,100
of a IT product or service.

20
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,540
Now, when we think about
IT Asset Management,

21
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,630
what I want you to think about is the fact

22
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,080
that it's like inventory.

23
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,100
We want to know all of
the different components

24
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,040
that are out inside our organization

25
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,550
and what they're doing for us.

26
00:00:58,550 --> 00:00:59,960
Because if I know what they all are,

27
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,100
I can help maximize the
value, I can control the cost,

28
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,880
I can manage the risks, and
I can support decision-making

29
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,530
about future purchases.

30
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,870
So, if I think about it
in my company, we've got

31
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,610
a bunch of computers that we use.

32
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,530
Well, I need to keep
track of that computer

33
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,650
and how old it is.

34
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,640
So I know that, hey in three years I need

35
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,890
to replace that computer,
that's going to cost

36
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,070
x amount of dollars.

37
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,831
So we need to start budgeting for that.

38
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:24,350
IT Asset Management helps us do that.

39
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,210
It helps us plan and manage
the full life cycle of these

40
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,300
IT Assets, from purchase,
to use, to retirement

41
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,790
and then replacement.

42
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,350
That's the whole concept here.

43
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,480
And again, any asset that
is a valuable component

44
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,330
can be considered an IT Asset.

45
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,620
It's going to contribute to
the delivery of an IT service

46
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,420
or a product, it's part of our IT Assets.

47
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,460
That might mobile phones,
servers, network gear, racks,

48
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,071
switches, computers,
laptops, desktops, monitors,

49
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:53,210
you name it.

50
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,793
It's probably an IT Asset.
