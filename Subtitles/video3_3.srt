1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,040
- Information and Technology.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,420
It's our second dimension,

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,710
and when we talk about these dimensions

4
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,790
it's the perspective that we're looking at

5
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,420
those products and services through

6
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,170
so we can co-create that
value for our consumers.

7
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,280
We look at it from information technology.

8
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,800
These are two different things.

9
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,510
We have the information,
and we have the technology

10
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,360
that we're going to
hold the information in.

11
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,060
Let's start with technologies
'cause that's the one

12
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,110
that's probably easier to understand.

13
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,810
When we talk about technology,
this is all the things

14
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,630
that an information technology specialist

15
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,470
is going to deal with on a daily basis.

16
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,720
That's the servers, the
mobile phones, the laptops,

17
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,390
the desktops, the routers, the
switches, all of that stuff.

18
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,090
But when we talk about technology,

19
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,690
it's really split up into
two different things.

20
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,500
There's technologies
that are going to support

21
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,070
the IT Service and there's
technologies that are going to

22
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,650
support the IT Service Management.

23
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,250
Notice there's a difference there.

24
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,310
Now I talk about the IT Services.

25
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,890
Let's say that you're Uber.

26
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,160
You're going to be a ride sharing service.

27
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,590
What technologies do you
need to provide your service?

28
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,890
You have to have a website.
You have to have an app.

29
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,180
You need to have servers
and infrastructure.

30
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,930
You need to have applications
and communication systems,

31
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,440
maybe some artificial intelligence

32
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,800
to send the right driver
to the right location.

33
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,550
You might be using cloud
computing and cognitive computing.

34
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:13,750
You may even be using Blockchain

35
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,530
if you're accepting Bitcoin for payment.

36
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,270
All of that stuff is the
stuff that we need to do

37
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,380
to get that service in the
hands of your consumer.

38
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,690
Now on the other side of
things, we have technologies

39
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,840
that support Service Management.

40
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,940
And when we're talking about
technologies supporting

41
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,080
IT Service Management, we're
talking about the things

42
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,020
that allow the business
to do it's function.

43
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,990
That's things like work flow management.

44
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,070
It might be your customer service tools.

45
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,530
It might be remote
collaboration so you can log in

46
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,150
to those IT services, those
servers and cloud services,

47
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,570
to go in and configure them.

48
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,700
It might be things like mobile platforms

49
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,720
or inventory systems so you can figure out

50
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,530
where all your spare parts are.

51
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,710
All the things that aren't
going to necessarily deliver

52
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,260
the service to the end user,

53
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,430
but are things the business needs anyway.

54
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,630
For example, you might have
an Intranet SharePoint site

55
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,040
that serves as your
knowledge base, and if so,

56
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,340
that would be a supporting IT
Service Management technology,

57
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,100
not an IT Services technology.

58
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,120
Now some of these
technologies will be the same.

59
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,700
You might be using cloud
computing in both areas.

60
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,460
You might be using artificial
intelligence in both areas.

61
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,100
But there is that difference there.

62
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,360
There's those things that
are supporting the end user,

63
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,320
those IT Services, and then
those things that are supporting

64
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,420
your internal staff so they
can support your end user,

65
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,950
and those things are going to be

66
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,940
the IT Service Management technologies.

67
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,700
That's the technology side of things.

68
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,640
Now, let's consider the
information side of things

69
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,700
as we look at our products and services.

70
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,610
For some of our services,
information management

71
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,240
is probably the primary means

72
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,200
of enabling that customer value.

73
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,390
For example, if you're a
newspaper that's online,

74
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,400
what are you delivering to your customers?

75
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,020
You're delivering information.

76
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,630
And so information management
is critical to that.

77
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,440
You might be a data analytics company

78
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,420
and you're providing data analysis

79
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,250
and the results of that data
analysis as information.

80
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,670
And so if that's the case,

81
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,128
information is very important to you.

82
00:03:03,128 --> 00:03:05,210
Information management has lots

83
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,660
of different challenges though,

84
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,540
because when you talk about information,

85
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,720
there's all these different things

86
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,410
we need to make sure are there

87
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,530
so the information can get
to where it needs to be

88
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,840
to add that value.

89
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,010
That's things like ensuring
we have availability

90
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,760
of the information,
reliability of the information,

91
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,660
accessibility of the information.

92
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,510
The information needs to be
timely, it needs to be accurate,

93
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,010
and it needs to be relevant.

94
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,150
All of these are factors
that we judge information by.

95
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,810
And if we can get all those six factors,

96
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,490
we probably have some
highly valuable information.

97
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,960
But, to maintain all those is a challenge,

98
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,310
and it's difficult.

99
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,100
To be able to do that,
we have to make sure

100
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,740
that we're providing good security for it,

101
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,450
and good IT services that
underlie those informations.

102
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,510
We meed to make sure we're meeting all the

103
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,180
regulatory compliance requirements

104
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,770
and the legal requirements.

105
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,240
All of this is things
that we have to consider

106
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,360
when we think about the
information dimension,

107
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,240
or that perspective as we look at

108
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,010
building out our products and services.

109
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:58,843
When we look at this

110
00:03:58,843 --> 00:04:00,730
and when we look at
information and technology,

111
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,960
what are some of the considerations

112
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,680
that we should be thinking of?

113
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,550
We should be thinking of

114
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,100
is this compatible with
the current architecture?

115
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,160
Is this going to work with

116
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,490
the technology we're already using?

117
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,850
Does it raise any kind of
regulatory, legal, compliance,

118
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,000
or information security control issues?

119
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,930
If I start holding a lot of
people's personal information,

120
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,550
how am I going to protect it for instance?

121
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,420
Because there's laws that
say I have to protect it.

122
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,570
The next thing is will
it continue to be viable

123
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,080
in the foreseeable future?

124
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,140
If I'm going to invest a
lot of money into moving

125
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,330
to this new server, is
this going to be good

126
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,250
for the next three to five years?

127
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,500
Or is this something that's
only going to be good

128
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,670
for three months?

129
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,410
If it's not good for
the foreseeable future,

130
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,030
we may want to rethink it.

131
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,150
When we think about new
technology, is it going to align

132
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,100
with the service provider or
the service consumer strategy?

133
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,730
We have to have a strategy
of where we're going.

134
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,160
For example, in my
company, we have a strategy

135
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,530
of what kind of courses we want to teach.

136
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,160
Even though I can teach probably 50

137
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,750
or even a hundred different courses,

138
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,330
there's only about 20 or 30 courses

139
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,820
that we have in our portfolio.

140
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,320
And the reason is, that
aligns with our strategy

141
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,860
where some of the other things don't.

142
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,550
And when you think about
this from your business,

143
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,730
you have to think about what's
in line with your strategy

144
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,030
and what isn't.

145
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,010
If you're a computer
company you probably want

146
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,090
to be doing things that build computers.

147
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,200
You don't want to start
doing healthcare services.

148
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,240
It doesn't align with your brand.

149
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,270
Next we're going to think about

150
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,171
does the organization
have the right skills

151
00:05:18,171 --> 00:05:21,180
to support and maintain the technology?

152
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,300
For example, if you're going

153
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,030
to move all your stuff to the cloud,

154
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,340
do you have people who know
how to run Azure and AWS?

155
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,170
Because those are skills
you're going to need,

156
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,140
and running cloud servers is different

157
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,200
than running your own server farm.

158
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,630
The next consideration
we have to think about

159
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,150
is is it going to have enough
automation capabilities

160
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,540
that you can develop it, and
deploy it, and operate it

161
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,330
with less people in the future?

162
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,420
Because we're always trying
to minimize our overhead

163
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,880
and lower our costs.

164
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,330
Anything that can be automated,

165
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,110
we probably want to automate it.

166
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,240
Another thing we have to think about is

167
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,390
does it have additional
capabilities that we can leverage

168
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,290
for other products and services?

169
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,610
This is an interesting one.

170
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:55,680
If you think about this,

171
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,080
this is actually how Amazon
Web Services Started.

172
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,719
Amazon had to start
building large server farms

173
00:06:01,719 --> 00:06:06,200
so that they could start selling
more product as amazon.com.

174
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,680
But as they did that they
built up a lot of capability,

175
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,370
and they go oh wait I bet
other businesses would like

176
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,810
to have this capability too.

177
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,490
And they started selling it is
AWS, or Amazon Web Services.

178
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,290
Maybe that might apply
to your business as well.

179
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,400
As you're doing some
kind of new capability,

180
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,330
you're going to buy
something for one capability

181
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,100
but it brings you other capabilities.

182
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,140
And that now may add to your
product or service line,

183
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,259
just like Amazon did with AWS.

184
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:31,210
And finally we want to think about

185
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,780
does this new technology
introduce new risks

186
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,580
or new constraints to your organization?

187
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,830
If I'm going to move
everything to the cloud,

188
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,870
how is that going to work

189
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,840
from a data loss prevention strategy?

190
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,760
How is that going to work

191
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,910
from a regulation compliance strategy?

192
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,480
All of those are things we have
to think about in the risk.

193
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,140
When we think about risk,
we're actually going to go back

194
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,850
to our last dimension as well.

195
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,130
It's going to go back to
our organizational culture.

196
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,680
Depending on the nature of
your organization's business

197
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,180
and the culture you have,

198
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,250
you may be more or less risk averse.

199
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,920
For example, if you're a small start-up

200
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,890
out in Silicon Valley,
you're probably willing

201
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,640
to take a lot of risk,

202
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,457
but if you're a big established company,

203
00:07:07,457 --> 00:07:10,270
you probably don't want
to take a lot of risks.

204
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,011
You want to make sure things are stable,

205
00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:13,890
accurate, and reliable.

206
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,090
Those things are things
you have to consider

207
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,940
which technologies you're
going to implement.

208
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,740
Are you going to get the cutting
edge, which is more risky,

209
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,250
or are you going to get
something that's more stable

210
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,820
and tried and true?

211
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,620
Again, these are all
different considerations

212
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,453
to think about.

213
00:07:26,453 --> 00:07:28,980
But the bottom line,
especially for the exam,

214
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,400
is that one of the dimensions we're going

215
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,290
to be thinking about when
we're building our product

216
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:36,190
or service is based on the
information and technology,

217
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,579
and figuring out how that
information technology

218
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:41,883
is going to impact the
service for the long haul.
