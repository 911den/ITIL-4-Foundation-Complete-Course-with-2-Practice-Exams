00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,560
- Portfolio management, our next practice

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,830
we're going to discuss for your general

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,090
knowledge is portfolio management.

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,280
This is the practice of
ensuring that an organization

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,660
has the right mix of
programs, projects, products,

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,920
and services to execute its strategy

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,630
within its funding and
resource constraints.

8
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,190
Now, what does this really means?

9
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,750
Let's take my company for
example Dion Training.

10
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,590
There are a lot of different
products, projects, programs

11
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,660
and services that we could be using.

12
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,290
We could be doing a
lot of different things

13
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,910
but we have to figure out
what works with our strategy.

14
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,920
For example, we might make
practice exam courses,

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,040
we might make video courses, we might

16
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,330
do live training, we might create apps

17
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,530
in the app store, we might write a book.

18
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,000
There's lots of things that we can do.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,260
And in our first couple of years,

20
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,680
we did a lot of those things;
in fact all of those things.

21
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,580
But over time we figured out
where our true strengths were.

22
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,960
And we figured out what our
vision for the company was,

23
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,880
and we build a strategy around it.

24
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,690
So now, based on that
strategy, we've assigned

25
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,960
certain funding, and
resource and strengths,

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,710
the biggest resource constraint is really

27
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,100
the amount of people we have
that can teach this stuff,

28
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,070
and having the right
people on staff to do it,

29
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,220
and so we're limited in the
amount of stuff we can do.

30
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,040
So, based on those
restraints, we figure out

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,980
what is the proper mix of
programs, projects, products

32
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,560
and services to give
you the best experience

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,950
and give you the most bang for your buck.

34
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,670
For us for example,
inside the ITIL framework,

35
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,020
we do the foundation of
exams and we're going to

36
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,090
do all of the ITIL for exams.

37
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:29,210
That was a decision we
made, but we are not doing

38
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,510
all of the ITIL three,
intermediate certifications,

39
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,710
because those were coming to end of life

40
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,410
in the next 12 to 18 months
and so it didn't make sense

41
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,500
for our vision and our strategy
to put a lot of resources

42
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,650
into building those exams when

43
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,740
those exams were going to be
sunset in just 12 or 18 months.

44
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,280
Whereas ITIL four is brand new

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,610
and will last for many years to come.

46
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,970
That's the idea inside your organization.

47
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,890
You need to think about
what is the right mix

48
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,070
of products and services and programs

49
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,400
and portfolio management
helps you do that.

50
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,470
You figure out exactly
what you want to do,

51
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,070
and then you build towards that.
