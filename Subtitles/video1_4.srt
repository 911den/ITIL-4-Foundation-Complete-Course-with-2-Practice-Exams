1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,330
- In today's digital economy,

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:03,960
every organization in the world

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,290
has become a service organization.

4
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:07,590
You may think your organization

5
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,230
isn't a service organization,

6
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,970
but when you really look at
what it does on a daily basis,

7
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,660
it truly is a service organization.

8
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,590
For example,

9
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:17,080
you may work for a grocery store,

10
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,350
and you may think you're in the business

11
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,100
of selling milk and cereal,

12
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,580
which are both products,

13
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,390
but in reality you're probably really

14
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,280
a service organization too.

15
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,410
Most of the services,

16
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,810
if not all of the services

17
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,880
that your company
currently owns and manages,

18
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,600
is done to co-create
value with your customers.

19
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,780
And these are enabled by
information technology.

20
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,690
Now, how can I make this claim?

21
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,530
Well, let's consider the
large retailer like Walmart,

22
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,970
who sells a large variety
of different products,

23
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,930
from diapers to groceries to
electronics and car tires.

24
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,060
Walmart has been wildly successful

25
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,030
in selling all of these
different products,

26
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,140
but the particular products Walmart sells,

27
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,020
doesn't really matter that much.

28
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,310
Instead the real reason that
Walmart has been so successful,

29
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:59,910
is that their available
to provide a service

30
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,390
to their customers that no one else

31
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,760
has been able to do the way they have.

32
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,340
And that is a collection of
services that's enabled by IT.

33
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,470
Walmart, for example,

34
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,290
has created a wonderfully robust

35
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,250
distribution and logistics system

36
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,380
to get their products
to their stores quickly,

37
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,090
efficiently and more cost
effectively than other people.

38
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,300
And this allows them to rely

39
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,400
on complex inventory tracking
and logistic systems,

40
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,050
that are all run by various
IT components and services.

41
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,430
They've been able to do
this to provide products

42
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,050
at their everyday low price,

43
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,590
which is actually the service

44
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,260
they provide to their customers.

45
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,290
Walmart's service is
bringing you the products

46
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,670
you want or need at the
lowest price, always.

47
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,040
Other stores can't bring
that to you at the same level

48
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,060
or the same cost that Walmart can.

49
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,260
So in a price battle,

50
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,310
Walmart is going to win every time,

51
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,630
because of their ability to embrace IT

52
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,370
to enable their services.

53
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,640
But how is Walmart
co-creating value with me,

54
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,090
the customer?

55
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,690
Lets say I was having a party tonight,

56
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,660
and I've invited you over for dinner.

57
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,560
I might run over to Walmart to
buy all the supplies I need.

58
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,200
Things like meat and cheeses,

59
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,560
vegetables and drinks,

60
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,620
and I bring them all back to my kitchen.

61
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,400
I then use all those ingredients

62
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,470
to cook a meal for my party tonight.

63
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,990
The value isn't the ingredients
that I got from Walmart.

64
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,390
It's the outcome that I had

65
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,740
when I co-created value with Walmart.

66
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,420
Walmart provided all the
ingredients at a low price,

67
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,380
and I've provided the
ability to cook it all up

68
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,870
into a delicious meal.

69
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,820
Now the value is the
happiness and the full bellies

70
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,910
of all of my guests at my party.

71
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,060
This is the value co-created
through the service.

72
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,080
Now as you think about all
the different industries

73
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,630
and organizations in the world,

74
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,130
it's really hard to think of any

75
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,160
that aren't providing some kind of service

76
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,000
that is enabled by technology.

77
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,550
Because of this technology
has become common place

78
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,090
in the modern workplace.

79
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,540
But all of this technology
needs to be managed

80
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,000
in order for it to be
effective and enabling value

81
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,490
to your customers by providing services.

82
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,840
And this brings us to the
concept of service management.

83
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,300
Service management is defined

84
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,250
as a set of specialized
organizational capabilities

85
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,670
for enabling value to customers
in the form of services.

86
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,315
The purpose of ITIL 4 is
to provide organizations,

87
00:03:03,315 --> 00:03:06,590
working in this modern service economy,

88
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,220
with guidance from managing
their information technology

89
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,110
and information technology
dependencies effectively,

90
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,440
efficiently and in some coordinated,

91
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,270
structured and integrated way

92
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,740
that combines the agility,

93
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,750
the time to market,

94
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,360
and their ability to
deliver new things faster,

95
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,010
while using their risk controls
and providing insurance

96
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,770
that the services will be
performed properly today,

97
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,870
tomorrow and any day
further off into the future.

98
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,910
Notice this isn't just
about providing a service

99
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,230
fast to a customer,

100
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,110
but it's also about being
able to balance that

101
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,880
with the proper controls so that

102
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,950
that is providing a quality service,

103
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,880
now and into the future.

104
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,840
This ensures that there's
a balance of speed

105
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,130
in control within our
organizations and their services.

106
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,384
Simply put, ITIL 4 provides organizations

107
00:03:48,384 --> 00:03:51,860
with a comprehensive framework
for IT service management.

108
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,720
This framework is designed
to ensure that an effective,

109
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,340
efficient, flexible,

110
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,540
coordinated and integrated system

111
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,990
for the governance and management

112
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,030
of services is established.

113
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,293
It also is concerned with
ensuring that these services

114
00:04:04,293 --> 00:04:07,660
are continually improving
within your organization.

115
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,300
Now, if you're new to the business world

116
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,820
or information technology,

117
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,720
the word, governance,

118
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,150
might be one that you're
not quite familiar with.

119
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,490
Governance is simply the means

120
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,420
by which an organization
is directed and controlled.

121
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,930
This means that it involves
all of the processes needed

122
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:24,240
to govern or oversee the
running of the organization.

123
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,090
For example, in the United States,

124
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,840
our government creates
rules and laws that are used

125
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,730
as a method to direct the
actions of its citizens.

126
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,340
This is called governance, right?

127
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,340
It's the way that we operate a country.

128
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,800
Well, organizations need governance too.

129
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,850
And at your company,

130
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,530
there's a process probably
for everything you need to do.

131
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,100
Think about it if you wanted
to take two weeks of vacation.

132
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,130
You couldn't simply decide
just to not go to work

133
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,070
for two weeks without
telling your boss, right?

134
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,920
You'd probably end up loosing your job.

135
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,753
Now instead,

136
00:04:50,753 --> 00:04:52,868
you're going to go through the
process to request a vacation,

137
00:04:52,868 --> 00:04:54,613
and that process is going to be different

138
00:04:54,613 --> 00:04:57,570
based on your organization
or my organization.

139
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,750
Because each organization runs itself

140
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,400
and its process is differently.

141
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,900
That way that they run things,

142
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,273
that's known as governance.
