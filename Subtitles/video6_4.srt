1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,600
- The next value chain
activity we're going to cover

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,210
is the engage value chain activity.

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:07,800
The purpose of the engage
value chain activity

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,380
is to provide a good understanding

5
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,410
of the stakeholder needs, to
ensure continual engagement

6
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,640
with all of the stakeholders is occurring,

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,790
and to promote good transparency
and good relationships

8
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,740
with all of our stakeholders.

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,530
Really, when we talk about engage,

10
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,550
think about going out and
talking to other people.

11
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,930
That's what we're really doing

12
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,960
at the heart of this engage process.

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,740
This is going to be going
out to our stakeholders

14
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:33,140
both internally and externally
to our organization.

15
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,780
So when I think about the different inputs

16
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,420
to the engage activity here,

17
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,690
I'm thinking about the
product and service portfolio

18
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,350
that I'm going to get from plans.

19
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,590
When I get the product
and service portfolio,

20
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,690
I then can think about, who do I need

21
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:45,880
to start engaging with?

22
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,170
Who needs to know about this new roadmap?

23
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,880
Who needs to know that there's
a new product coming online?

24
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,790
Who needs to know what they
can provide into that service

25
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,740
or to that part of that service portfolio?

26
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,270
That's the whole idea
there, is communicating that

27
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,850
inward and outward across the organization

28
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,480
and out to your partners.

29
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,430
Also, we're going to be looking for inputs

30
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,250
for high-level demand for
services and products.

31
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,470
This is something we're going to see

32
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,690
usually from our customers,
and so as part of engage,

33
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,760
we're going to listen to our
customers and what they want.

34
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,970
For example, if I have a hundred students

35
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,160
who reach out to me and
tell me, hey, Jason,

36
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,530
I want you to start offering
X certification product,

37
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,820
we might start listening to that

38
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,970
and go build that certification,
and put that into our plans

39
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,280
and move that throughout
our whole lifecycle, right?

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,140
It all depends on what the demand is

41
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,710
for our services and our products,

42
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,800
and we listen to our customers on that.

43
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,460
One of the reasons why we
offer the PRINCE2 certification

44
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,930
is because a lot of my
IDOL students had said,

45
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,670
hey, I want to get a project
management certification.

46
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,670
Will you offer PRINCE2?

47
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,500
And so we went out, because
we had a large enough demand,

48
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,920
and we did that.

49
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,500
Another input is the
request and feedback you get

50
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,650
from your customers.

51
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,830
As you go through this course,

52
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,030
we ask for reviews and feedback from you.

53
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,420
If you tell us that you don't like it

54
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,830
because Jason talks too
long in his examples,

55
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,120
then next time we build a
course, we'll use less examples.

56
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,230
We've gotten a lot of that type
of feedback over the years,

57
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,110
of things we can change and make better,

58
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,230
and we implement that each and every time.

59
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,600
You want to do the same
thing with your IT services.

60
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,830
You're always wanting to get
feedback from your customers

61
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:16,010
and then using that feedback,
you can make a better product.

62
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,310
Next, we also want to
think about the incidents,

63
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,410
the service requests, and
feedback from your end users.

64
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,760
This may be different from
your customers, right?

65
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,420
In my case, my customers are my users,

66
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,230
but if we look at this
from a large IT stance,

67
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,980
I might have a customer who buys a service

68
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,400
for hundreds of users underneath them.

69
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,040
In that case, I need to think
about the feedback differently

70
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,750
from the customer level
and from the user level.

71
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,210
When you take all that input in,

72
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,690
it helps you in your engagement

73
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,320
to figure out what you're doing right,

74
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,890
and then you can pass that information

75
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,630
over to the improve process,

76
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,340
so they can then work it
into improvement plans.

77
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,610
Also, another input we have is information

78
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,880
on the completion of user support tasks,

79
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,360
from delivery and support.

80
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,140
One of the big things that your engage

81
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,470
is going to be working closely
with, is delivery and support,

82
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,200
because in deliver and support,

83
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,140
that's where your service
desk comes into play.

84
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,170
That's where your
operations comes into play.

85
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,520
That's where you're
going to be reaching out

86
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,050
and touching your end users,

87
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,810
and getting their feedback directly,

88
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,110
so being able to look at that

89
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,710
and feeding that information back

90
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,660
through deliver and support,
into the engage process,

91
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,520
and from engage, out to the other parts

92
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,710
of the service value
chain, is really important.

93
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,680
Next, we also want to consider on input

94
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,350
of our market opportunities.

95
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,720
As we look at the market,

96
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,860
and we see what the demand looks
like and the opportunities,

97
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,610
we can then figure out what our current

98
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,530
and potential customers
and users might want,

99
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,380
and based on that and seeing that

100
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,220
and engaging with the marketplace,

101
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,900
we can determine and
feed that back into plans

102
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,580
to put it into the overall
strategy for the company.

103
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,170
Another input is making sure

104
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,980
we have cooperation opportunities

105
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,570
and feedback being provided

106
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,500
by not just our customers and our users,

107
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,260
but also from our partners
and our suppliers.

108
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:58,150
For example, we rely on
AWS, or Amazon Web Services,

109
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,030
to host our website currently.

110
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,680
We want to make sure we have
a good partnership with them,

111
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,720
or at least a good supplier relationship,

112
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,450
where we can talk to them and
figure out what other services

113
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,690
do you offer that might
be able to help us?

114
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,600
What type of opportunities exist?

115
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,800
And understanding those
opportunities for cooperation

116
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,850
and feedback from our
partners and suppliers

117
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:19,420
can help us to better supply
a service to our end user.

118
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,420
Another input we have is our contracts

119
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,800
and our agreement requirements.

120
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,980
As we look at all of those

121
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,140
from across the entire value chain,

122
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,420
we also are going to be
doing all of the engagement.

123
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,900
Any time we're talking about
contracts and agreements,

124
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,960
you can be assured we're talking
about the engage activity,

125
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,370
because we're reaching
outside of our organization

126
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,400
to make that contract happen.

127
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,060
Another thing we're
going to get as an input

128
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,630
to our engage activity is
the knowledge and information

129
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,870
about new and changed
products and services,

130
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,630
both from design and transition
and obtain and build.

131
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,410
You'll notice some of
these things have happened

132
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,930
in multiple different activities, why?

133
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,320
Because this is a coordinated
and interlinked effort.

134
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,270
Next, we have our
knowledge and information

135
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,130
about our third party service components,

136
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,830
from suppliers and partners.

137
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,300
Just like we did before,
we have that again here

138
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,100
inside the engage activity.

139
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,720
We also want to make sure
we're getting product

140
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,630
and service information
from across the lifecycle

141
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,700
and from the deliver and support team.

142
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,390
As they feed that into us,
we can then coordinate it,

143
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,340
and push it out across all
of the different pieces

144
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,560
and the different activities
in our service value chain.

145
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,940
Next, we also have our
improvement initiatives and plans.

146
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,260
We're going to get those from improve,

147
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,070
and as the engagement folks,

148
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,450
what are we going to do with those?

149
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,730
Well, we're going to
tell people about them.

150
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,810
Hey, students, we're improving the course

151
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,150
and releasing a new course on X day.

152
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,480
We get that from the plans,
and then we pass it out

153
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,700
to our customers, our
users, and our consumers.

154
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,600
And finally, we also want to
get improvement status reports

155
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,450
from improve, and then again,

156
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:47,840
we can share that information
out as part of engage.

157
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,050
When I think about engage,
I always like to think

158
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,670
about telling people something.

159
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm communicating with somebody, right?

160
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,660
So what are some of the outputs we have

161
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,320
when we talk about engage?

162
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,080
Well, we have consolidated
demands and opportunities.

163
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,600
As we collected all that
information from the marketplace

164
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,060
and our customers, we're
now going to turn around,

165
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,460
consolidate it, and pass it over to plans

166
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,250
so they can put that into
our overarching plans.

167
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,450
We're also going to look at our product

168
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,320
and service requirements that we got

169
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,460
and we're going to give those
to design and transition

170
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,400
so they can build better services.

171
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,480
We're also going to take
the user support tasks

172
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,200
and requirements and give those
over to delivery and support

173
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,940
so they can actually provide
the end users what they need,

174
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,440
so if you as a student
come to the engage part

175
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,770
of our company, and say,
I need more study guides,

176
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,130
then we can then pass that

177
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,320
over to design and
transition, who can design it,

178
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,600
then we can give it to obtain
and build, who will build it,

179
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,070
and then we give it to
deliver and support,

180
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,000
who will deliver it to you as a student,

181
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,850
and it works that way

182
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,980
where these processes are interrelated.

183
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,590
We're also going to have an output
of improvement opportunities

184
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,000
and stakeholder feedback
as we collect all of that,

185
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,720
because we're the ones interacting

186
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,630
with all of those external organizations.

187
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,130
We're going to take that and pass it

188
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,250
over to the improve process or activity,

189
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,860
so they can work with it.

190
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,670
We're also going to get things like change

191
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,170
or project initiative requests,

192
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,660
and we're going to get all
of those, consolidate them,

193
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,960
and pass them over to the obtain/build.

194
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,890
Again, we're dealing
with contracts, right?

195
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,330
And agreements, and if we get
those contracts and agreements

196
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,410
from the external and internal suppliers,

197
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,990
we're then going to pass those
over to obtain and build,

198
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,980
and design and transition, so
that they can get the services

199
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,500
and products that those
contracts rely upon.

200
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,960
We're also going to be
looking at the output

201
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,090
of knowledge and information

202
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,210
about our third-party service components,

203
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,220
because we collected all that information,

204
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,390
but we as engage aren't
going to do much with it.

205
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,240
Instead, we want to pass
it to the plans folks,

206
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,490
the design folks, the transition folks,

207
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,580
the obtain and build folks,
the deliver and support folks.

208
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,360
All of them need this information,

209
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,730
and we're the people who collect it,

210
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,970
so we're responsible
for passing it back out.

211
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,150
And finally, one of
the things we collected

212
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,170
was service performance reports, right?

213
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,400
We got all of that information

214
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,860
from all of the different
parts of the service,

215
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,230
and now we want to communicate
that back out to our customers.

216
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,890
Hey, our availability is 99.999%

217
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,710
as measured by X, Y and Z.

218
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,310
Let me give that report to the customers

219
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,980
so they know what they're getting.

220
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,700
That's the idea in engage.

221
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,950
Engage is the glue that makes
all of this service work.

222
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,130
It's all of the communication that occurs.

223
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,320
Things come in, things get processed,

224
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,590
and things get pushed out,

225
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:17,040
to and from all the different
activities, processes,

226
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,570
customers, stakeholders, consumers,

227
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,240
and suppliers and partners.

228
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,170
All of that works because
engage is at the center of it.

229
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,263
It's all the people who make
the communication happen.
